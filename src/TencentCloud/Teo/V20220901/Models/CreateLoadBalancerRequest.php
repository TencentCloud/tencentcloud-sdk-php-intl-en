 * CreateLoadBalancer request structure.
 *
 * @method string getZoneId() Obtain Zone ID.
 * @method void setZoneId(string $ZoneId) Set Zone ID.
 * @method string getName() Obtain LoadBalancer name, which can contain 1 to 200 characters, including a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscores (_), and hyphens (-).
 * @method void setName(string $Name) Set LoadBalancer name, which can contain 1 to 200 characters, including a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscores (_), and hyphens (-).
 * @method string getType() Obtain LoadBalancer type. Valid values:
<li>HTTP: HTTP-specific LoadBalancer. It supports adding HTTP-specific and general origin server groups. It can only be referenced by site acceleration services (such as domain name service and rule engine).</li>
<li>GENERAL: general LoadBalancer. It only supports adding general origin server groups. It can be referenced by site acceleration services (such as domain name service and rule engine) and Layer-4 proxy.</li>
 * @method void setType(string $Type) Set LoadBalancer type. Valid values:
<li>HTTP: HTTP-specific LoadBalancer. It supports adding HTTP-specific and general origin server groups. It can only be referenced by site acceleration services (such as domain name service and rule engine).</li>
<li>GENERAL: general LoadBalancer. It only supports adding general origin server groups. It can be referenced by site acceleration services (such as domain name service and rule engine) and Layer-4 proxy.</li>
 * @method array getOriginGroups() Obtain List of origin server groups and their corresponding disaster recovery scheduling priorities. For details, refer to Sample Scenario in [Quickly Create Load Balancers](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1552/104223?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method void setOriginGroups(array $OriginGroups) Set List of origin server groups and their corresponding disaster recovery scheduling priorities. For details, refer to Sample Scenario in [Quickly Create Load Balancers](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1552/104223?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method HealthChecker getHealthChecker() Obtain Health check policy. For details, refer to [Health Check Policies](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1552/104228?from_cn_redirect=1). If left empty, health check is disabled by default.
 * @method void setHealthChecker(HealthChecker $HealthChecker) Set Health check policy. For details, refer to [Health Check Policies](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1552/104228?from_cn_redirect=1). If left empty, health check is disabled by default.
 * @method string getSteeringPolicy() Obtain Traffic scheduling policy among origin server groups. Valid values:
<li>Priority: Perform failover according to priority.</li>The default value is Priority.
 * @method void setSteeringPolicy(string $SteeringPolicy) Set Traffic scheduling policy among origin server groups. Valid values:
<li>Priority: Perform failover according to priority.</li>The default value is Priority.
 * @method string getFailoverPolicy() Obtain Request retry policy when access to an origin server fails. For details, refer to [Introduction to Request Retry Strategy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1552/104227?from_cn_redirect=1). Valid values:
<li>OtherOriginGroup: After a single request fails, retry with another origin server within the next lower priority origin server group.</li>
<li>OtherRecordInOriginGroup: After a single request fails, retry with another origin server within the same origin server group.</li> The default value is OtherRecordInOriginGroup.
 * @method void setFailoverPolicy(string $FailoverPolicy) Set Request retry policy when access to an origin server fails. For details, refer to [Introduction to Request Retry Strategy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1552/104227?from_cn_redirect=1). Valid values:
