 * DescribeRealtimeLogDeliveryTasks request structure.
 *
 * @method string getZoneId() Obtain Zone ID.
 * @method void setZoneId(string $ZoneId) Set Zone ID.
 * @method integer getOffset() Obtain The offset of paginated query. Default value: 0.
 * @method void setOffset(integer $Offset) Set The offset of paginated query. Default value: 0.
 * @method integer getLimit() Obtain The limit of paginated query. Default value: 20. Maximum value: 1000.
 * @method void setLimit(integer $Limit) Set The limit of paginated query. Default value: 20. Maximum value: 1000.
 * @method array getFilters() Obtain Filter conditions. The maximum value for Filters.Values is 20. If this field is not filled in, all the real-time log delivery task information under the current zone-id will be returned. Detailed filter conditions are as follows:
<li>task-id: Filter by real-time log delivery task ID. Fuzzy search is not supported.</li>
<li>task-name: Filter by real-time log delivery task name. Fuzzy search is supported, but only one real-time log delivery task name can be filled in for fuzzy search.</li>
