 * CheckFreeCertificateVerification response structure.
 *
 * @method string getCommonName() Obtain Specifies the domain name to which the certificate is issued when the free certificate application succeeds.
Note: only one free certificate can be applied for a domain name. if a wildcard certificate has been applied for the domain name, its subdomains will use the wildcard certificate.
 * @method void setCommonName(string $CommonName) Set Specifies the domain name to which the certificate is issued when the free certificate application succeeds.
Note: only one free certificate can be applied for a domain name. if a wildcard certificate has been applied for the domain name, its subdomains will use the wildcard certificate.
 * @method string getSignatureAlgorithm() Obtain Specifies the signature algorithm used by the certificate when the free certificate application succeeds. currently only support RSA 2048.
 * @method void setSignatureAlgorithm(string $SignatureAlgorithm) Set Specifies the signature algorithm used by the certificate when the free certificate application succeeds. currently only support RSA 2048.
 * @method string getExpireTime() Obtain Expiration time of the certificate when the free certificate application is successful. the time is in coordinated universal time (UTC), following the ISO 8601 standard date and time format.
 * @method void setExpireTime(string $ExpireTime) Set Expiration time of the certificate when the free certificate application is successful. the time is in coordinated universal time (UTC), following the ISO 8601 standard date and time format.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
