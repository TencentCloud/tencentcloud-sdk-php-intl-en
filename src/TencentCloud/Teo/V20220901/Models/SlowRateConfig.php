Note: This field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method integer getThreshold() Obtain The transfer rate threshold in bps. When the transfer rate of a sample is lower than the threshold, it’s considered a slow attack and handled according to the specified `Action`.
Note: This field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
