/**
 * DescribeSecurityTemplateBindings response structure.
 *
 * @method array getSecurityTemplate() Obtain Bindings of the specified policy template.

When a domain name of a site is bound with the specified policy template, `TemplateScope` includes the `ZoneId` of the related site and the bindings of the domain name. 

Note: If the template is not bound with any domain name, and there is not any existing binding, `TemplateScope=0` is returned.

In the binding list, the same domain name may appear repeatedly in the `EntityStatus` list with different `Status`. For example, when a domain name is being bound to another policy template, it's marked both `online` and `pending`.
 * @method void setSecurityTemplate(array $SecurityTemplate) Set Bindings of the specified policy template.

When a domain name of a site is bound with the specified policy template, `TemplateScope` includes the `ZoneId` of the related site and the bindings of the domain name. 

Note: If the template is not bound with any domain name, and there is not any existing binding, `TemplateScope=0` is returned.

In the binding list, the same domain name may appear repeatedly in the `EntityStatus` list with different `Status`. For example, when a domain name is being bound to another policy template, it's marked both `online` and `pending`.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
