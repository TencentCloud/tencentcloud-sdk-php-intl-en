 * CreateOriginGroup request structure.
 *
 * @method string getZoneId() Obtain Site ID
 * @method void setZoneId(string $ZoneId) Set Site ID
 * @method string getName() Obtain Origin group name. It can contain 1 to 200 characters ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9] and [_-]).
 * @method void setName(string $Name) Set Origin group name. It can contain 1 to 200 characters ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9] and [_-]).
 * @method string getType() Obtain (Required) Origin group type. Values:
<li>`GENERAL`: General origin groups. It supports IPs and domain names. It can be referenced by DNS, Rule Engine, Layer 4 Proxy and General LoadBalancer. </li>
<li>`HTTP`: HTTP-specific origin groups. It supports IPs/domain names and object storage buckets. It can be referenced by acceleration domain names, rule engines and HTTP LoadBalancer. It cannot be referenced by L4 proxies. </li>
 * @method void setType(string $Type) Set (Required) Origin group type. Values:
<li>`GENERAL`: General origin groups. It supports IPs and domain names. It can be referenced by DNS, Rule Engine, Layer 4 Proxy and General LoadBalancer. </li>
<li>`HTTP`: HTTP-specific origin groups. It supports IPs/domain names and object storage buckets. It can be referenced by acceleration domain names, rule engines and HTTP LoadBalancer. It cannot be referenced by L4 proxies. </li>
 * @method array getRecords() Obtain (Required) Origins in the origin group.
 * @method void setRecords(array $Records) Set (Required) Origins in the origin group.
 * @method string getHostHeader() Obtain Host header used for origin-pull. It only works when `Type=HTTP`. The `HostHeader` specified in `RuleEngine` takes a higher priority over this configuration.
 * @method void setHostHeader(string $HostHeader) Set Host header used for origin-pull. It only works when `Type=HTTP`. The `HostHeader` specified in `RuleEngine` takes a higher priority over this configuration.
