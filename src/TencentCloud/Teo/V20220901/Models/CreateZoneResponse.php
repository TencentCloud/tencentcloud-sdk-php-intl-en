If `Type=partial`, add TXT records to your DNS provider or add files to the root DNS server, and then call [VerifyOwnership]() to complete verification. For more information, see [Ownership Verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1552/70789?from_cn_redirect=1).

If `Type = full`, switch the DNS server as instructed by [Modifying DNS Server](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1552/90452?from_cn_redirect=1). Then call [VerifyOwnership]() to check the result.

If `Type = noDomainAccess`, leave it blank. No action is required.
Note: This field may return·null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
