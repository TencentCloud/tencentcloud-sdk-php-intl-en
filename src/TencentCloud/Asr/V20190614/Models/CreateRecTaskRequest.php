Note: If you want to recognize telecommunication audio but find that a 16k engine is required, you can use a 16k engine as described below for recognition. However, ** the 16k engines are not trained for recognizing telecommunication audio. Therefore, the recognition results cannot be guaranteed. You need to check whether the recognition results can be used. **

Engines for general scenarios:
** Note: Use 16k engines for scenarios other than telecommunication. **

This engine supports recognizing audio in Chinese, English, and [various Chinese dialects] (https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1093/35682?from_cn_redirect=1). It has a large number of parameters, enhanced performance, and greatly improved recognition accuracy for low-quality audio with loud noise, too much echo, low voice volume, or faint voices. [Click here] (https://console.cloud.tencent.com/asr/demonstrate) to compare the recognition performance of the 16k_zh engine and this one.

- Restrictions for individual terms: The format is "term|weight". Each term can contain no more than 30 characters (or 10 Chinese characters. The weight can be in the range of [1-11] or 100. For example, "Tencent Cloud|5" or "ASR|11".

- Restrictions for the temporary term list: Multiple terms are separated by commas. The list can contain up to 128 terms. For example, "Tencent Cloud|10, Audio Recognition|5, ASR|11".

- Difference between hotword_id (term list) and hotword_list (temporary term list):

    - hotword_id: Term list. You need to create a term list in the console or by using the API first and obtain the term list ID.

    - hotword_list: Temporary term list. You can directly enter the ID of the temporary term list each time you initiate a request. The temporary term list is not retained on the cloud. This parameter applies to users with a massive number of terms.

Notes:

- If both hotword_id and hotword_list are specified, hotword_list will take effect first.

- When the weight of a term is set to 11, this term becomes a super term. It is recommended that the weight is set to 11 only for critical and necessary terms. The overall accuracy will be affected if the weight is set to 11 for too many terms.

- When the weight of a term is set to 100, the term enhancement feature is enabled to replace homophones of this term. (This feature is supported only for 8k_zh and 16k_zh engines.) For example, if you configure "mizhi 1|100", the recognized word "mizhi 2", which is a homophone of "mizhi 2", will be forcibly replaced with "mizhi 2". It is recommended that you enable this feature based on the actual needs. You can set the weight to 100 for only critical and necessary terms. The overall accuracy will be affected if the weight is set to 100 for too many terms.
 * @method void setHotwordList(string $HotwordList) Set Temporary term list. This parameter is used to improve the recognition accuracy.

Engines for general scenarios:
** Note: Use 16k engines for scenarios other than telecommunication. **
** 16k_zh_large: ** Engine (large model version) for Mandarin, Chinese dialects, and English. This engine supports recognizing audio in Chinese, English, and [various Chinese dialects] (https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1093/35682?from_cn_redirect=1). It has a large number of parameters, enhanced performance, and greatly improved recognition accuracy for low-quality audio with loud noise, too much echo, low voice volume, or faint voices. [Click here] (https://console.cloud.tencent.com/asr/demonstrate) to compare the recognition performance of the 16k_zh engine and this one.

** 16k_zh-PY: ** Engine for Chinese, English, and Cantonese. The engine supports recognizing audio in Mandarin, English, and Cantonese at the same time.
