 * ModifyDBInstanceNetworkAddress request structure.
 *
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Specifies the ID of the instance for modifying the network. For example, cmgo-p8vn****. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/MongoDB) and copy the instance ID from the instance list.

 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Specifies the ID of the instance for modifying the network. For example, cmgo-p8vn****. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/MongoDB) and copy the instance ID from the instance list.

 * @method integer getOldIpExpiredTime() Obtain Retention period of the original IP address.
 - Unit: minutes. 0 means that the IP address is immediately repossessed.
 - The original IP address will be released after a scheduled period. Both the original and new IP addresses are accessible before release.

 * @method void setOldIpExpiredTime(integer $OldIpExpiredTime) Set Retention period of the original IP address.
 - Unit: minutes. 0 means that the IP address is immediately repossessed.
 - The original IP address will be released after a scheduled period. Both the original and new IP addresses are accessible before release.

 * @method string getNewUniqVpcId() Obtain VPC ID after the switch. If the instance is using a basic network, this field is not required. The [DescribeDBInstances](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38568?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the VPC ID.
 * @method void setNewUniqVpcId(string $NewUniqVpcId) Set VPC ID after the switch. If the instance is using a basic network, this field is not required. The [DescribeDBInstances](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38568?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the VPC ID.
 * @method string getNewUniqSubnetId() Obtain VPC subnet ID after the switch. If the instance is using a basic network, this field is not required. The [DescribeDBInstances](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38568?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the subnet ID of the VPC.
 * @method void setNewUniqSubnetId(string $NewUniqSubnetId) Set VPC subnet ID after the switch. If the instance is using a basic network, this field is not required. The [DescribeDBInstances](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38568?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the subnet ID of the VPC.
 * @method array getNetworkAddresses() Obtain IP address information, including the new IP address and the original IP address.
 * @method void setNetworkAddresses(array $NetworkAddresses) Set IP address information, including the new IP address and the original IP address.
