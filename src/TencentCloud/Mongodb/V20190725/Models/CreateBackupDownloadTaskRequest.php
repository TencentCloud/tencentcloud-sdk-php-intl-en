 * CreateBackupDownloadTask request structure.
 *
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Instance ID in the format of "cmgo-p8vnipr5", which is the same as the instance ID displayed in the TencentDB console.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Instance ID in the format of "cmgo-p8vnipr5", which is the same as the instance ID displayed in the TencentDB console.
 * @method string getBackupName() Obtain The name of the backup file to be downloaded, which can be obtained by the `DescribeDBBackups` API.
 * @method void setBackupName(string $BackupName) Set The name of the backup file to be downloaded, which can be obtained by the `DescribeDBBackups` API.
 * @method array getBackupSets() Obtain Specify the node name of a replica set instance or the shard name list of a sharded cluster instance. Only backups of the specified node or shards will be downloaded.
Suppose you have a replica set instance (ID: cmgo-p8vnipr5), you can use the sample code `BackupSets.0=cmgo-p8vnipr5_0` to download the full backup. For a replica set instance, the parameter value must be in the format of "instance ID_0".
Suppose you have a sharded cluster instance (ID: cmgo-p8vnipr5), you can use the sample code `BackupSets.0=cmgo-p8vnipr5_0&BackupSets.1=cmgo-p8vnipr5_1` to download the backup data of shard 0 and shard 1. To download the full backup, please specify all shard names.
 * @method void setBackupSets(array $BackupSets) Set Specify the node name of a replica set instance or the shard name list of a sharded cluster instance. Only backups of the specified node or shards will be downloaded.
Suppose you have a replica set instance (ID: cmgo-p8vnipr5), you can use the sample code `BackupSets.0=cmgo-p8vnipr5_0` to download the full backup. For a replica set instance, the parameter value must be in the format of "instance ID_0".
