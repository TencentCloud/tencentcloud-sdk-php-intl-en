 * InquirePriceModifyDBInstanceSpec request structure.
 *
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Instance ID. For example, cmgo-p8vn****. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb), and copy the instance ID from the instance list.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Instance ID. For example, cmgo-p8vn****. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb), and copy the instance ID from the instance list.
 * @method integer getMemory() Obtain Instance memory size after configuration changes, in GB. The [DescribeSpecInfo](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38567?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the specific sales specifications for memory.
 * @method void setMemory(integer $Memory) Set Instance memory size after configuration changes, in GB. The [DescribeSpecInfo](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38567?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the specific sales specifications for memory.
 * @method integer getVolume() Obtain Instance disk size after configuration changes, in GB. The [DescribeSpecInfo](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38567?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the maximum and minimum disk sizes corresponding to each CPU specification.
 * @method void setVolume(integer $Volume) Set Instance disk size after configuration changes, in GB. The [DescribeSpecInfo](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38567?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the maximum and minimum disk sizes corresponding to each CPU specification.

- Replica set instance, which refers to the number of primary and secondary nodes for the instance after configuration changes.
- Sharded cluster instance, which refers to the number of primary and secondary nodes per shard for the instance after configuration changes.
**Note**: Do not initiate tasks of adjusting the number of nodes and shards and the node specifications simultaneously.
 * @method void setNodeNum(integer $NodeNum) Set Number of instance nodes. The [DescribeSpecInfo](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/240/38567?from_cn_redirect=1) API can be called to obtain the number of instance nodes.

- Sharded cluster instance, which refers to the number of primary and secondary nodes per shard for the instance after configuration changes.
**Note**: Do not initiate tasks of adjusting the number of nodes and shards and the node specifications simultaneously.
 * @method integer getReplicateSetNum() Obtain Sharded cluster instance, which refers to the number of shards for the instance after configuration changes. Value range: [2, 36].
**Note**: The number of shards after changes cannot be less than the current number. Do not initiate tasks of adjusting the number of nodes and shards and the node specifications simultaneously.
 * @method void setReplicateSetNum(integer $ReplicateSetNum) Set Sharded cluster instance, which refers to the number of shards for the instance after configuration changes. Value range: [2, 36].
