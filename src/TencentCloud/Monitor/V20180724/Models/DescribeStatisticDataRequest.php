 * @method string getModule() Obtain Module, whose value is fixed at `monitor`
 * @method void setModule(string $Module) Set Module, whose value is fixed at `monitor`
 * @method string getNamespace() Obtain Namespace. Valid values: `QCE`, `TKE2`.
 * @method void setNamespace(string $Namespace) Set Namespace. Valid values: `QCE`, `TKE2`.
 * @method array getMetricNames() Obtain Metric name list
 * @method void setMetricNames(array $MetricNames) Set Metric name list
 * @method array getConditions() Obtain Dimension condition. The `=` and `in` operators are supported
 * @method void setConditions(array $Conditions) Set Dimension condition. The `=` and `in` operators are supported

300s: The time range is less than three days, and the timespan between `StartTime` and the current time cannot exceed 31 days.
3,600s: The time range is less than 30 days, and the timespan between `StartTime` and the current time cannot exceed 93 days.
86,400s: The time range is less than 186 days, and the timespan between `StartTime` and the current time cannot exceed 186 days.
 * @method void setPeriod(integer $Period) Set Statistical period in seconds. Default value: 300. Optional values: 60, 300, 3,600, and 86,400.
