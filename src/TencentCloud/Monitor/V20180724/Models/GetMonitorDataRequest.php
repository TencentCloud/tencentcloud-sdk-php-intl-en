/**
 * GetMonitorData request structure.
 *
 * @method string getNamespace() Obtain Namespace, such as QCE/CVM. For more information on the namespaces of each Tencent Cloud service, please see [Tencent Cloud Service Metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6140?from_cn_redirect=1)
 * @method void setNamespace(string $Namespace) Set Namespace, such as QCE/CVM. For more information on the namespaces of each Tencent Cloud service, please see [Tencent Cloud Service Metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6140?from_cn_redirect=1)
 * @method string getMetricName() Obtain Metric name, such as `CPUUsage`. Only one monitoring metric can be pulled at a time. For more information on the metrics of each Tencent Cloud service, please see [Tencent Cloud Service Metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6140?from_cn_redirect=1). The corresponding metric name is `MetricName`.
 * @method void setMetricName(string $MetricName) Set Metric name, such as `CPUUsage`. Only one monitoring metric can be pulled at a time. For more information on the metrics of each Tencent Cloud service, please see [Tencent Cloud Service Metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6140?from_cn_redirect=1). The corresponding metric name is `MetricName`.
 * @method array getInstances() Obtain The dimension combination for instance objects, which is in the form of a set of key-value pairs. The dimension fields for instances of different Tencent Cloud services are completely different. For example, the field is [{"Name":"InstanceId","Value":"ins-j0hk02zo"}] for CVM instances, [{"Name":"instanceId","Value":"ckafka-l49k54dd"}] for CKafka instances, and [{"Name":"appid","Value":"1258344699"},{"Name":"bucket","Value":"rig-1258344699"}] for COS instances. For more information on the dimensions of various Tencent Cloud services, please see [Tencent Cloud Service Metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6140?from_cn_redirect=1). In each document, the dimension column displays a dimension combination’s key, which has a corresponding value. A single request can get the data of up to 10 instances.
 * @method void setInstances(array $Instances) Set The dimension combination for instance objects, which is in the form of a set of key-value pairs. The dimension fields for instances of different Tencent Cloud services are completely different. For example, the field is [{"Name":"InstanceId","Value":"ins-j0hk02zo"}] for CVM instances, [{"Name":"instanceId","Value":"ckafka-l49k54dd"}] for CKafka instances, and [{"Name":"appid","Value":"1258344699"},{"Name":"bucket","Value":"rig-1258344699"}] for COS instances. For more information on the dimensions of various Tencent Cloud services, please see [Tencent Cloud Service Metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6140?from_cn_redirect=1). In each document, the dimension column displays a dimension combination’s key, which has a corresponding value. A single request can get the data of up to 10 instances.
 * @method integer getPeriod() Obtain Monitoring statistical period in seconds, such as 60. Default value: 300. The statistical period varies by metric. For more information on the statistical periods supported by each Tencent Cloud service, please see [Tencent Cloud Service Metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6140?from_cn_redirect=1). The values in the statistical period column are the supported statistical periods. A single request can get up to 1,440 data points.
 * @method void setPeriod(integer $Period) Set Monitoring statistical period in seconds, such as 60. Default value: 300. The statistical period varies by metric. For more information on the statistical periods supported by each Tencent Cloud service, please see [Tencent Cloud Service Metrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6140?from_cn_redirect=1). The values in the statistical period column are the supported statistical periods. A single request can get up to 1,440 data points.
 * @method string getStartTime() Obtain Start time such as 2018-09-22T19:51:23+08:00
 * @method void setStartTime(string $StartTime) Set Start time such as 2018-09-22T19:51:23+08:00
 * @method string getEndTime() Obtain End time, which is the current time by default, such as 2018-09-22T20:51:23+08:00. `EndTime` cannot be earlier than `StartTime`
 * @method void setEndTime(string $EndTime) Set End time, which is the current time by default, such as 2018-09-22T20:51:23+08:00. `EndTime` cannot be earlier than `StartTime`
