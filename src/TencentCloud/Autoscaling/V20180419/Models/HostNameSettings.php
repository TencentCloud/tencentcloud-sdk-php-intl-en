/**
 * CVM HostName settings
 *
 * @method string getHostName() Obtain CVM HostName.
<li>Dots (.) and hyphens (-) cannot be used as the first or last character of HostName, and cannot be used consecutively.</li>
<li>Windows instances are not supported.</li>
<li>Instances of other types (e.g., Linux): The length of the character should be within the range of [2, 40]. Multiple dots (.) are allowed. Each segment between dot marks can consist of letters (case-insensitive), digits, and hyphens (-). Using only digits is not allowed.</li>
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setHostName(string $HostName) Set CVM HostName.
<li>Dots (.) and hyphens (-) cannot be used as the first or last character of HostName, and cannot be used consecutively.</li>
<li>Windows instances are not supported.</li>
<li>Instances of other types (e.g., Linux): The length of the character should be within the range of [2, 40]. Multiple dots (.) are allowed. Each segment between dot marks can consist of letters (case-insensitive), digits, and hyphens (-). Using only digits is not allowed.</li>
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getHostNameStyle() Obtain The style of the CVM HostName. Valid values include ORIGINAL and UNIQUE, and the default value is ORIGINAL.
<li>ORIGINAL: AS passes HostName filled in the input parameters to CVM. CVM may append serial numbers to HostName, which can result in conflicts with HostName of instances in the scaling group.</li>
<li> UNIQUE: HostName filled in the input parameters acts as a prefix for the HostName. AS and CVM will expand this prefix to ensure that HostName of the instance in the scaling group is unique.</li>
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setHostNameStyle(string $HostNameStyle) Set The style of the CVM HostName. Valid values include ORIGINAL and UNIQUE, and the default value is ORIGINAL.
<li>ORIGINAL: AS passes HostName filled in the input parameters to CVM. CVM may append serial numbers to HostName, which can result in conflicts with HostName of instances in the scaling group.</li>
<li> UNIQUE: HostName filled in the input parameters acts as a prefix for the HostName. AS and CVM will expand this prefix to ensure that HostName of the instance in the scaling group is unique.</li>
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getHostNameSuffix() Obtain HostName suffix for CVM.
<li>Dots (.) and hyphens (-) cannot be used as the first or last character of HostNameSuffix, and cannot be used consecutively.</li>
<li>Windows instances are not supported.</li>
<li>Instances of other types (e.g., Linux): The length of the character should be within the range of [1, 37], and the combined length with HostName should not exceed 39. Multiple dots (.) are allowed. Each segment between dots can consist of letters (case-insensitive), digits, and hyphens (-).</li>
Assume the suffix name is suffix and the original HostName is test.0, then the final HostName is test.0.suffix.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setHostNameSuffix(string $HostNameSuffix) Set HostName suffix for CVM.
<li>Dots (.) and hyphens (-) cannot be used as the first or last character of HostNameSuffix, and cannot be used consecutively.</li>
<li>Windows instances are not supported.</li>
<li>Instances of other types (e.g., Linux): The length of the character should be within the range of [1, 37], and the combined length with HostName should not exceed 39. Multiple dots (.) are allowed. Each segment between dots can consist of letters (case-insensitive), digits, and hyphens (-).</li>
