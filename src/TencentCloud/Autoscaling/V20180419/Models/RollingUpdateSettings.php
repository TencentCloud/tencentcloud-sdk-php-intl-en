After this parameter is set, create a batch of additional pay-as-you-go instances according to the launch configuration before the rolling update starts. After the rolling update is completed, the additional instances will be terminated.This parameter is used to ensure a certain number of instances available during the rolling update. The maximum additional quantity of instances cannot exceed the number of refreshing instances in a single batch of the rolling update. The rollback process does not support this parameter currently.
