/**
 * Indicates audio segment information
 *
 * @method string getOffsetTime() Obtain This field is used to return the start time of an audio segment in seconds. For audio on demand files, this parameter indicates the time offset of the audio from the complete audio track, such as 0 (no offset), 5 (5 seconds after the start of the audio track), and 10 (10 seconds after the start of the audio track). For live audio stream files, this parameter returns the Unix timestamp of the start of the audio segment, such as `1594650717`.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setOffsetTime(string $OffsetTime) Set This field is used to return the start time of an audio segment in seconds. For audio on demand files, this parameter indicates the time offset of the audio from the complete audio track, such as 0 (no offset), 5 (5 seconds after the start of the audio track), and 10 (10 seconds after the start of the audio track). For live audio stream files, this parameter returns the Unix timestamp of the start of the audio segment, such as `1594650717`.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method AudioResult getResult() Obtain This field is used to return the specific moderation result of an audio segment. For details, see the description of the `AudioResult` data structure.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setResult(AudioResult $Result) Set This field is used to return the specific moderation result of an audio segment. For details, see the description of the `AudioResult` data structure.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
