 * @method string getUserId() Obtain The robot's UserId is used to enter a room and initiate tasks. [Note] This UserId cannot be repeated with the host viewer [UserId](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/46351#userid) in the current room. If multiple tasks are initiated in a room, the robot's UserId cannot be repeated, otherwise the previous task will be interrupted. The robot's UserId must be unique in the room.
 * @method void setUserId(string $UserId) Set The robot's UserId is used to enter a room and initiate tasks. [Note] This UserId cannot be repeated with the host viewer [UserId](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/46351#userid) in the current room. If multiple tasks are initiated in a room, the robot's UserId cannot be repeated, otherwise the previous task will be interrupted. The robot's UserId must be unique in the room.
 * @method string getUserSig() Obtain The verification signature corresponding to the robot's UserId, that is, UserId and UserSig are equivalent to the robot's login password to enter the room. For the specific calculation method, please refer to the TRTC calculation [UserSig](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/45910#UserSig) solution.
 * @method void setUserSig(string $UserSig) Set The verification signature corresponding to the robot's UserId, that is, UserId and UserSig are equivalent to the robot's login password to enter the room. For the specific calculation method, please refer to the TRTC calculation [UserSig](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/45910#UserSig) solution.
 * @method integer getMaxIdleTime() Obtain If there is no streaming in the room for more than MaxIdleTime, the background will automatically close the task. The default value is 60s.
 * @method void setMaxIdleTime(integer $MaxIdleTime) Set If there is no streaming in the room for more than MaxIdleTime, the background will automatically close the task. The default value is 60s.
 * @method integer getTranscriptionMode() Obtain 1 means the robot subscribes to the stream of only one person, 0 means the robot subscribes to the stream of the entire room. If it is not filled in, the robot subscribes to the stream of the entire room by default.
 * @method void setTranscriptionMode(integer $TranscriptionMode) Set 1 means the robot subscribes to the stream of only one person, 0 means the robot subscribes to the stream of the entire room. If it is not filled in, the robot subscribes to the stream of the entire room by default.
 * @method string getTargetUserId() Obtain Required when TranscriptionMode is 1. The robot will only pull the stream of the userid and ignore other users in the room.
 * @method void setTargetUserId(string $TargetUserId) Set Required when TranscriptionMode is 1. The robot will only pull the stream of the userid and ignore other users in the room.
