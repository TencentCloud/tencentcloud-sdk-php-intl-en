 * @method string getCommId() Obtain Unique ID of a call: sdkappid_roomgString_createTime. The `roomgString` refers to the room ID, and `createTime` refers to the creation time of a room in the format of UNIX timestamp in seconds, such as 1400353843_218695_1590065777. Its value can be obtained from the `DescribeRoomInformation` API (related document: https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/44050?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method void setCommId(string $CommId) Set Unique ID of a call: sdkappid_roomgString_createTime. The `roomgString` refers to the room ID, and `createTime` refers to the creation time of a room in the format of UNIX timestamp in seconds, such as 1400353843_218695_1590065777.
