 * @method string getCommId() Obtain The unique ID of a call, whose format is `SdkAppId_CreateTime`, such as `1400xxxxxx_218695_1590065777`. `createTime` is the UNIX timestamp (seconds) when the room was created. Its value can be obtained using the [DescribeRoomInfo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/44050?from_cn_redirect=1) API.
 * @method void setCommId(string $CommId) Set The unique ID of a call, whose format is `SdkAppId_CreateTime`, such as `1400xxxxxx_218695_1590065777`. `createTime` is the UNIX timestamp (seconds) when the room was created. Its value can be obtained using the [DescribeRoomInfo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/44050?from_cn_redirect=1) API.
 * @method integer getStartTime() Obtain The start time, which is a Unix timestamp (seconds) in local time, such as `1590065777`.
Note: Only data in the last 14 days can be queried.
 * @method void setStartTime(integer $StartTime) Set The start time, which is a Unix timestamp (seconds) in local time, such as `1590065777`.
Note: Only data in the last 14 days can be queried.
 * @method integer getEndTime() Obtain The end time, which is a Unix timestamp (seconds) in local time, such as `1590065877`.
Note: If you pass in an end time later than the room end time, the room end time will be used.
 * @method void setEndTime(integer $EndTime) Set The end time, which is a Unix timestamp (seconds) in local time, such as `1590065877`.
Note: If you pass in an end time later than the room end time, the room end time will be used.
 * @method string getUserId() Obtain The user ID.
 * @method void setUserId(string $UserId) Set The user ID.
 * @method string getRoomId() Obtain The room ID, such as `223`.
 * @method void setRoomId(string $RoomId) Set The room ID, such as `223`.
 * @method integer getSdkAppId() Obtain The application ID, such as `1400xxxxxx`.
 * @method void setSdkAppId(integer $SdkAppId) Set The application ID, such as `1400xxxxxx`.
