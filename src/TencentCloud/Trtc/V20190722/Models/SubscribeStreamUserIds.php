/**
 * The subscription allowlist/blocklist. You cannot specify an allowlist and a blocklist for audio/video subscription at the same time. The maximum number of streams one can receive at the same time is 25. When streams are mixed, up to 24 videos are supported. You can use `.*$` to specify user IDs with the same prefix, but make sure there arenâ€™t users whose IDs contain ".*$" and are exactly the same as the prefix you pass in. If there are, TRTC will only allow or block those users.
 *
 * @method array getSubscribeAudioUserIds() Obtain The allowlist for audio subscription. For example, `["1", "2", "3"]` means to only subscribe to the audios of users 1, 2, and 3, and ["1.*$"] means to only subscribe to the audios of users whose ID prefix is `1`. If this parameter is left empty, the audios of all anchors in the room will be received. The array can contain at most 32 elements.
 * @method void setSubscribeAudioUserIds(array $SubscribeAudioUserIds) Set The allowlist for audio subscription. For example, `["1", "2", "3"]` means to only subscribe to the audios of users 1, 2, and 3, and ["1.*$"] means to only subscribe to the audios of users whose ID prefix is `1`. If this parameter is left empty, the audios of all anchors in the room will be received. The array can contain at most 32 elements.
 * @method array getUnSubscribeAudioUserIds() Obtain The blocklist for audio subscription. For example, `["1", "2", "3"]` means to not subscribe to the audios of users 1, 2, and 3, and `["1.*$"]` means to not subscribe to users whose ID prefix is `1`. If this parameter is left empty, the audios of all anchors in the room will be received. The array can contain at most 32 elements.
 * @method void setUnSubscribeAudioUserIds(array $UnSubscribeAudioUserIds) Set The blocklist for audio subscription. For example, `["1", "2", "3"]` means to not subscribe to the audios of users 1, 2, and 3, and `["1.*$"]` means to not subscribe to users whose ID prefix is `1`. If this parameter is left empty, the audios of all anchors in the room will be received. The array can contain at most 32 elements.
 * @method array getSubscribeVideoUserIds() Obtain The allowlist for video subscription. For example, `["1", "2", "3"]` means to only subscribe to the videos of users 1, 2, and 3, and `["1.*$"]` means to only subscribe to the videos of users whose ID prefix is `1`. If this parameter is left empty, the videos of all anchors in the room will be received. The array can contain at most 32 elements.
 * @method void setSubscribeVideoUserIds(array $SubscribeVideoUserIds) Set The allowlist for video subscription. For example, `["1", "2", "3"]` means to only subscribe to the videos of users 1, 2, and 3, and `["1.*$"]` means to only subscribe to the videos of users whose ID prefix is `1`. If this parameter is left empty, the videos of all anchors in the room will be received. The array can contain at most 32 elements.
 * @method array getUnSubscribeVideoUserIds() Obtain The blocklist for video subscription. For example, `["1", "2", "3"]` means to not subscribe to the videos of users 1, 2, and 3, and `["1.*$"]` means to not subscribe to the videos of users whose ID prefix is `1`. If this parameter is left empty, the videos of all anchors in the room will be received. The array can contain at most 32 elements.
 * @method void setUnSubscribeVideoUserIds(array $UnSubscribeVideoUserIds) Set The blocklist for video subscription. For example, `["1", "2", "3"]` means to not subscribe to the videos of users 1, 2, and 3, and `["1.*$"]` means to not subscribe to the videos of users whose ID prefix is `1`. If this parameter is left empty, the videos of all anchors in the room will be received. The array can contain at most 32 elements.
