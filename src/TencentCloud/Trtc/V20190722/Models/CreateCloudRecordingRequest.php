/**
 * CreateCloudRecording request structure.
 *
 * @method integer getSdkAppId() Obtain The [SDKAppID](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714) of the TRTC room whose streams are recorded.
 * @method void setSdkAppId(integer $SdkAppId) Set The [SDKAppID](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714) of the TRTC room whose streams are recorded.
 * @method string getRoomId() Obtain The [room ID](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714) of the TRTC room whose streams are recorded.
 * @method void setRoomId(string $RoomId) Set The [room ID](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714) of the TRTC room whose streams are recorded.
 * @method string getUserId() Obtain The [user ID](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/37714#userid) of the recording robot in the TRTC room, which cannot be identical to the user IDs of anchors in the room or other recording robots. To distinguish this user ID from others, we recommend you include the room ID in the user ID.
 * @method void setUserId(string $UserId) Set The [user ID](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/37714#userid) of the recording robot in the TRTC room, which cannot be identical to the user IDs of anchors in the room or other recording robots. To distinguish this user ID from others, we recommend you include the room ID in the user ID.
 * @method string getUserSig() Obtain The signature (similar to a login password) required for the recording robot to enter the room. Each user ID corresponds to a signature. For information on how to calculate the signature, see [What is UserSig?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/38104).
 * @method void setUserSig(string $UserSig) Set The signature (similar to a login password) required for the recording robot to enter the room. Each user ID corresponds to a signature. For information on how to calculate the signature, see [What is UserSig?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/38104).
 * @method RecordParams getRecordParams() Obtain The on-cloud recording parameters.
 * @method void setRecordParams(RecordParams $RecordParams) Set The on-cloud recording parameters.
 * @method StorageParams getStorageParams() Obtain The storage information of the recording file. Currently, you can save recording files to Tencent Cloud VOD or COS.
 * @method void setStorageParams(StorageParams $StorageParams) Set The storage information of the recording file. Currently, you can save recording files to Tencent Cloud VOD or COS.
 * @method integer getRoomIdType() Obtain The type of the TRTC room ID, which must be the same as the ID type of the room whose streams are recorded.
0: String
1: 32-bit integer (default)
 * @method void setRoomIdType(integer $RoomIdType) Set The type of the TRTC room ID, which must be the same as the ID type of the room whose streams are recorded.
0: String
1: 32-bit integer (default)
 * @method MixTranscodeParams getMixTranscodeParams() Obtain The stream mixing parameters, which are valid if the mixed-stream recording mode is used.
 * @method void setMixTranscodeParams(MixTranscodeParams $MixTranscodeParams) Set The stream mixing parameters, which are valid if the mixed-stream recording mode is used.
 * @method MixLayoutParams getMixLayoutParams() Obtain The layout parameters, which are valid if the mixed-stream recording mode is used.
 * @method void setMixLayoutParams(MixLayoutParams $MixLayoutParams) Set The layout parameters, which are valid if the mixed-stream recording mode is used.
 * @method integer getResourceExpiredHour() Obtain The amount of time (in hours) during which API requests can be made after recording starts. Calculation starts when a recording task is started (when the recording task ID is returned). Once the period elapses, the query, modification, and stop recording APIs can no longer be called, but the recording task will continue. The default value is `72` (three days), and the maximum and minimum values allowed are `720` (30 days) and `6` respectively. If you do not set this parameter, the query, modification, and stop recording APIs can be called within 72 hours after recording starts.
 * @method void setResourceExpiredHour(integer $ResourceExpiredHour) Set The amount of time (in hours) during which API requests can be made after recording starts. Calculation starts when a recording task is started (when the recording task ID is returned). Once the period elapses, the query, modification, and stop recording APIs can no longer be called, but the recording task will continue. The default value is `72` (three days), and the maximum and minimum values allowed are `720` (30 days) and `6` respectively. If you do not set this parameter, the query, modification, and stop recording APIs can be called within 72 hours after recording starts.
 * @method string getPrivateMapKey() Obtain The permission ticket for a TRTC room. This parameter is required if advanced permission control is enabled in the console, in which case the TRTC backend will verify users’ [PrivateMapKey](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/32240?from_cn_redirect=1), which include an encrypted room ID and permission bit list. A user providing only `UserSig` and not `PrivateMapKey` will be unable to enter the room.
 * @method void setPrivateMapKey(string $PrivateMapKey) Set The permission ticket for a TRTC room. This parameter is required if advanced permission control is enabled in the console, in which case the TRTC backend will verify users’ [PrivateMapKey](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/32240?from_cn_redirect=1), which include an encrypted room ID and permission bit list.
