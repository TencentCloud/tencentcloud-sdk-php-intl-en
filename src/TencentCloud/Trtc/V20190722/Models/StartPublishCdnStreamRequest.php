 * StartPublishCdnStream request structure.
 *
 * @method integer getSdkAppId() Obtain The [SDKAppID](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714) of the TRTC room whose streams are relayed.
 * @method void setSdkAppId(integer $SdkAppId) Set The [SDKAppID](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714) of the TRTC room whose streams are relayed.
 * @method string getRoomId() Obtain The ID of the room whose streams are relayed (the main room).
 * @method void setRoomId(string $RoomId) Set The ID of the room whose streams are relayed (the main room).
 * @method integer getRoomIdType() Obtain The type of the `RoomId` parameter, which must be the same as the ID type of the room whose streams are relayed. 0: integer; 1: string.
 * @method void setRoomIdType(integer $RoomIdType) Set The type of the `RoomId` parameter, which must be the same as the ID type of the room whose streams are relayed. 0: integer; 1: string.
 * @method AgentParams getAgentParams() Obtain The information of the relaying robot in the room.
 * @method void setAgentParams(AgentParams $AgentParams) Set The information of the relaying robot in the room.
 * @method integer getWithTranscoding() Obtain Whether to transcode the streams. `0`: No. `1`: Yes. This parameter determines whether transcoding fees are charged. If it is `0`, streams will only be relayed, and no transcoding fees will be incurred. If it is `1`, streams will be transcoded before being relayed, and transcoding fees will be incurred.
 * @method void setWithTranscoding(integer $WithTranscoding) Set Whether to transcode the streams. `0`: No. `1`: Yes. This parameter determines whether transcoding fees are charged. If it is `0`, streams will only be relayed, and no transcoding fees will be incurred. If it is `1`, streams will be transcoded before being relayed, and transcoding fees will be incurred.
 * @method McuAudioParams getAudioParams() Obtain The audio encoding parameters. Because audio is always transcoded (no fees are incurred), this parameter is required when you start a relay task.
 * @method void setAudioParams(McuAudioParams $AudioParams) Set The audio encoding parameters. Because audio is always transcoded (no fees are incurred), this parameter is required when you start a relay task.
 * @method McuVideoParams getVideoParams() Obtain The video encoding parameters for relaying. If you do not pass this parameter, only audio will be relayed.
 * @method void setVideoParams(McuVideoParams $VideoParams) Set The video encoding parameters for relaying. If you do not pass this parameter, only audio will be relayed.
 * @method SingleSubscribeParams getSingleSubscribeParams() Obtain The information of a single stream relayed. When you relay a single stream, set `WithTranscoding` to 0.
 * @method void setSingleSubscribeParams(SingleSubscribeParams $SingleSubscribeParams) Set The information of a single stream relayed. When you relay a single stream, set `WithTranscoding` to 0.
 * @method array getPublishCdnParams() Obtain The information of the CDNs to relay to. You need to specify at least one between this parameter and `FeedBackRoomParams.N`.
 * @method void setPublishCdnParams(array $PublishCdnParams) Set The information of the CDNs to relay to. You need to specify at least one between this parameter and `FeedBackRoomParams.N`.
 * @method McuSeiParams getSeiParams() Obtain The stream mixing SEI parameters.
 * @method void setSeiParams(McuSeiParams $SeiParams) Set The stream mixing SEI parameters.
 * @method array getFeedBackRoomParams() Obtain The information of the room to which streams are relayed. Between this parameter and `PublishCdnParams`, you must specify at least one. Please note that relaying to a TRTC room is only supported in some SDK versions. For details, please contact technical support.
 * @method void setFeedBackRoomParams(array $FeedBackRoomParams) Set The information of the room to which streams are relayed. Between this parameter and `PublishCdnParams`, you must specify at least one. Please note that relaying to a TRTC room is only supported in some SDK versions. For details, please contact technical support.
 * @method McuRecordParams getRecordParams() Obtain Relay Recording Parameters.
Example value:{"UniRecord":1,"RecordKey": "test_recore_key_a"}
 * @method void setRecordParams(McuRecordParams $RecordParams) Set Relay Recording Parameters.
Example value:{"UniRecord":1,"RecordKey": "test_recore_key_a"}
