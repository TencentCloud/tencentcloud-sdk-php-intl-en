 * Parameters for relaying to a TRTC room.
 *
 * @method string getRoomId() Obtain The room ID.
 * @method void setRoomId(string $RoomId) Set The room ID.
 * @method integer getRoomIdType() Obtain The ID type of the room to which streams are relayed. `0` indicates integer, and `1` indicates string.
 * @method void setRoomIdType(integer $RoomIdType) Set The ID type of the room to which streams are relayed. `0` indicates integer, and `1` indicates string.
 * @method string getUserId() Obtain The [user ID](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/37714) of the relaying robot in the TRTC room, which cannot be the same as a user ID already in use. We recommend you include the room ID in this user ID.

 * @method string getUserSig() Obtain The signature (similar to login password) required for the relaying robot to enter the room. For information on how to calculate the signature, see [What is UserSig?](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/38104).
 * @method void setUserSig(string $UserSig) Set The signature (similar to login password) required for the relaying robot to enter the room. For information on how to calculate the signature, see [What is UserSig?](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/38104).
