 * @method void setSdkAppId(integer $SdkAppId) Set The application ID, such as `1400xxxxxx`.
 * @method integer getStartTime() Obtain The start time, which is a Unix timestamp (seconds) in local time, such as `1590065777`.
Note: Only data in the last 14 days can be queried.

Note: Only data in the last 14 days can be queried.

Note: Data is collected on a daily basis. To query the data of a day, make sure the end time is later than 00:00 on that day. Otherwise, no data will be returned. For example, to query the data on the 20th, the end time must be later than 00:00 on the 20th.
