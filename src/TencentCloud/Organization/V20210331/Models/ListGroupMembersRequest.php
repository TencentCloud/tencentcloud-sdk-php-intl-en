/**
 * ListGroupMembers request structure.
 *
 * @method string getZoneId() Obtain Space ID.
 * @method void setZoneId(string $ZoneId) Set Space ID.
 * @method string getGroupId() Obtain User ID.
 * @method void setGroupId(string $GroupId) Set User ID.
 * @method string getNextToken() Obtain Token for querying the next page of returned results. During use of the API for the first time, NextToken is not needed. When you call the API for the first time, if the total number of returned data entries exceeds the MaxResults limit, the data is truncated and only MaxResults data entries are returned. Meanwhile, the return parameter IsTruncated is true and a NextToken is returned. You can use the NextToken returned last time to continue calling the API with other request parameters unchanged, to query the truncated data. You can use this method for multiple queries until IsTruncated is false, indicating that all data has been queried.
 * @method void setNextToken(string $NextToken) Set Token for querying the next page of returned results. During use of the API for the first time, NextToken is not needed. When you call the API for the first time, if the total number of returned data entries exceeds the MaxResults limit, the data is truncated and only MaxResults data entries are returned.

You can use this method for multiple queries until IsTruncated is false, indicating that all data has been queried.
 * @method integer getMaxResults() Obtain Maximum number of data entries per page. Value range: 1-100. Default value: 10.
 * @method void setMaxResults(integer $MaxResults) Set Maximum number of data entries per page. Value range: 1-100. Default value: 10.
