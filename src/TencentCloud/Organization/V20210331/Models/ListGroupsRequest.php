/**
 * ListGroups request structure.
 *
 * @method string getZoneId() Obtain Space ID.
 * @method void setZoneId(string $ZoneId) Set Space ID.
 * @method string getNextToken() Obtain Token for querying the next page of returned results. During use of the API for the first time, NextToken is not needed. When you call the API for the first time, if the total number of returned data entries exceeds the MaxResults limit, the data is truncated and only MaxResults data entries are returned. Meanwhile, the return parameter IsTruncated is true and a NextToken is returned. You can use the NextToken returned last time to continue calling the API with other request parameters unchanged, to query the truncated data. You can use this method for multiple queries until IsTruncated is false, indicating that all data has been queried.
 * @method void setNextToken(string $NextToken) Set Token for querying the next page of returned results. During use of the API for the first time, NextToken is not needed. When you call the API for the first time, if the total number of returned data entries exceeds the MaxResults limit, the data is truncated and only MaxResults data entries are returned. Meanwhile, the return parameter IsTruncated is true and a NextToken is returned. You can use the NextToken returned last time to continue calling the API with other request parameters unchanged, to query the truncated data. You can use this method for multiple queries until IsTruncated is false, indicating that all data has been queried.
 * @method integer getMaxResults() Obtain Maximum number of data entries per page. Value range: 1-100. Default value: 10.
 * @method void setMaxResults(integer $MaxResults) Set Maximum number of data entries per page. Value range: 1-100. Default value: 10.
 * @method string getFilter() Obtain Filter criterion. Format: <Attribute> <Operator> <Value>, case-insensitive. Currently, <Attribute> supports only GroupName, and <Operator> supports only eq (Equals) and sw (Start With). For example, Filter = "GroupName sw test" indicates querying all user groups with names starting with test; Filter = "GroupName eq testgroup" indicates querying the user group with the name testgroup.
 * @method void setFilter(string $Filter) Set Filter criterion. Format: <Attribute> <Operator> <Value>, case-insensitive. Currently, <Attribute> supports only GroupName, and <Operator> supports only eq (Equals) and sw (Start With). For example, Filter = "GroupName sw test" indicates querying all user groups with names starting with test; Filter = "GroupName eq testgroup" indicates querying the user group with the name testgroup.
 * @method string getGroupType() Obtain User group type. Manual: manually created; Synchronized: externally imported.
 * @method void setGroupType(string $GroupType) Set User group type. Manual: manually created; Synchronized: externally imported.
 * @method array getFilterUsers() Obtain Filtered user. IsSelected=1 will be returned for the user group associated with this user.
 * @method void setFilterUsers(array $FilterUsers) Set Filtered user. IsSelected=1 will be returned for the user group associated with this user.
 * @method string getSortField() Obtain Sorting field, which currently only supports CreateTime. The default is the CreateTime field.
 * @method void setSortField(string $SortField) Set Sorting field, which currently only supports CreateTime. The default is the CreateTime field.
 * @method string getSortType() Obtain Sorting type. Desc: descending order; Asc: ascending order. It should be set along with SortField.
 * @method void setSortType(string $SortType) Set Sorting type. Desc: descending order; Asc: ascending order. It should be set along with SortField.
 * @method integer getOffset() Obtain Pagination offset. Do not use it together with NextToken, prioritizing using NextToken.
 * @method void setOffset(integer $Offset) Set Pagination offset. Do not use it together with NextToken, prioritizing using NextToken.
