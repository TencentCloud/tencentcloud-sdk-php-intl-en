 * @method string getStreamName() Obtain Stream name.
 * @method void setStreamName(string $StreamName) Set Stream name.
 * @method string getAppName() Obtain Push path, which is the same as the `AppName` in push and playback addresses and is `live` by default.
 * @method void setAppName(string $AppName) Set Push path, which is the same as the `AppName` in push and playback addresses and is `live` by default.
 * @method string getDomainName() Obtain Push domain name. This parameter must be set for multi-domain name push.
 * @method void setDomainName(string $DomainName) Set Push domain name. This parameter must be set for multi-domain name push.
 * @method string getStartTime() Obtain Recording start time, which is China standard time and should be URL-encoded (RFC3986). For example, the encoding of 2017-01-01 10:10:01 is 2017-01-01+10%3a10%3a01.
In scheduled recording mode, this field must be set; in real-time video recording mode, this field is ignored.
 * @method void setStartTime(string $StartTime) Set Recording start time, which is China standard time and should be URL-encoded (RFC3986). For example, the encoding of 2017-01-01 10:10:01 is 2017-01-01+10%3a10%3a01.
In scheduled recording mode, this field must be set; in real-time video recording mode, this field is ignored.
 * @method string getEndTime() Obtain Recording end time, which is China standard time and should be URL-encoded (RFC3986). For example, the encoding of 2017-01-01 10:30:01 is 2017-01-01+10%3a30%3a01.
In scheduled recording mode, this field must be set; in real-time video recording mode, this field is optional. If the recording is set to real-time video recording mode through the `Highlight` parameter, the set end time should not be more than 30 minutes after the current time. If the set end time is more than 30 minutes after the current time, earlier than the current time, or left empty, the actual end time will be 30 minutes after the current time.
 * @method void setEndTime(string $EndTime) Set Recording end time, which is China standard time and should be URL-encoded (RFC3986). For example, the encoding of 2017-01-01 10:30:01 is 2017-01-01+10%3a30%3a01.
