/**
 * ModifyLiveDomainCertBindings request structure.
 *
 * @method array getDomainInfos() Obtain The playback domains to bind and whether to enable HTTPS for them.
If neither `CloudCertId` nor the public/private key is specified, and a domain is already bound with a certificate, this API will only update the HTTPS configuration of the domain and, if the certificate is a self-owned certificate, upload it to Tencent Cloud.
 * @method void setDomainInfos(array $DomainInfos) Set The playback domains to bind and whether to enable HTTPS for them.
If neither `CloudCertId` nor the public/private key is specified, and a domain is already bound with a certificate, this API will only update the HTTPS configuration of the domain and, if the certificate is a self-owned certificate, upload it to Tencent Cloud.
 * @method string getCloudCertId() Obtain The SSL certificate ID assigned by Tencent Cloud.
For details, see https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/400/41665?from_cn_redirect=1
 * @method void setCloudCertId(string $CloudCertId) Set The SSL certificate ID assigned by Tencent Cloud.
For details, see https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/400/41665?from_cn_redirect=1
 * @method string getCertificatePublicKey() Obtain The public key of the certificate.
You can specify either `CloudCertId` or the public/private key. If both are specified, the private and public key parameters will be ignored. If you pass in only the public and private keys, the corresponding certificate will be uploaded to Tencent Cloud SSL Certificate Service, which will generate a `CloudCertId` for the certificate.
 * @method void setCertificatePublicKey(string $CertificatePublicKey) Set The public key of the certificate.
You can specify either `CloudCertId` or the public/private key. If both are specified, the private and public key parameters will be ignored. If you pass in only the public and private keys, the corresponding certificate will be uploaded to Tencent Cloud SSL Certificate Service, which will generate a `CloudCertId` for the certificate.
 * @method string getCertificatePrivateKey() Obtain The private key of the certificate.
You can specify either `CloudCertId` or the public/private key. If both are specified, the private and public key parameters will be ignored. If you pass in only the public and private keys, the corresponding certificate will be uploaded to Tencent Cloud SSL Certificate Service, which will generate a `CloudCertId` for the certificate.
 * @method void setCertificatePrivateKey(string $CertificatePrivateKey) Set The private key of the certificate.
You can specify either `CloudCertId` or the public/private key. If both are specified, the private and public key parameters will be ignored. If you pass in only the public and private keys, the corresponding certificate will be uploaded to Tencent Cloud SSL Certificate Service, which will generate a `CloudCertId` for the certificate.
 * @method string getCertificateAlias() Obtain The remarks for the certificate in Tencent Cloud SSL Certificate Service. This parameter will be ignored if `CloudCertId` is specified.
 * @method void setCertificateAlias(string $CertificateAlias) Set The remarks for the certificate in Tencent Cloud SSL Certificate Service. This parameter will be ignored if `CloudCertId` is specified.
