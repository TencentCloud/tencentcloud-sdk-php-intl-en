 * @method Models\CreateLiveRecordResponse CreateLiveRecord(Models\CreateLiveRecordRequest $req) - Prerequisites
  1. Recording files are stored on the VOD platform, so if you need to use the recording feature, you must first activate the VOD service.
  2. After the recording files are stored, applicable fees (including storage fees and downstream playback traffic fees) will be charged according to the VOD billing mode. For more information, please see the [corresponding document](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/2838?from_cn_redirect=1).

- Mode description
  This API supports two recording modes:
  1. Scheduled recording mode **(default mode)**.
    The start time and end time need to be passed in, according to which the recording task will start and end automatically. Before the set end time expires (provided that `StopLiveRecord` is not called to terminate the task prematurely), the recording task is valid and will be started even after the push is interrupted and restarted multiple times.
  2. Real-time video recording mode.
    The start time passed in will be ignored, and recording will be started immediately after the recording task is created. The recording duration can be up to 30 minutes. If the end time passed in is more than 30 minutes after the current time, it will be counted as 30 minutes. Real-time video recording is mainly used for recording highlight scenes, and you are recommended to keep the duration within 5 minutes.

- Precautions
  1. The API call timeout period should be set to more than 3 seconds; otherwise, retries and calls by different start/end time values may result in repeated recording tasks and thus incur additional recording fees.
  2. Subject to the audio and video file formats (FLV/MP4/HLS), the video codec of H.264 and audio codec of AAC are supported.
  3. In order to avoid malicious or unintended frequent API requests, the maximum number of tasks that can be created in scheduled recording mode is limited: up to 4,000 tasks can be created per day (excluding deleted ones), and up to 400 ones can run concurrently. If you need a higher upper limit, please submit a ticket for application.
  4. This calling method does not support recording streams outside Mainland China for the time being.

 * @method Models\CreateRecordTaskResponse CreateRecordTask(Models\CreateRecordTaskRequest $req) This API is used to create a recording task that starts and ends at specific times and records videos according to a specific recording template.
- Prerequisites
1. Because recording files are saved in VOD, you must first activate VOD.
2. Storage and playback traffic fees are charged for storing and playing the videos recorded. For details, see [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/2837).
- Notes
1. If streaming is interrupted, the current recording will stop and a recording file will be generated. When streaming resumes, as long as it’s before the end time of the task, recording will start again.
2. Avoid creating recording tasks with overlapping time periods. If there are multiple tasks with overlapping time periods for the same stream, the system will start three recording tasks at most to avoid repeated recording.
3. Task records are kept for three months by the platform.
4. Do not use the new [CreateRecordTask](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/45983?from_cn_redirect=1), [StopRecordTask](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/45981?from_cn_redirect=1), and [DeleteRecordTask] APIs together with the old `CreateLiveRecord`, `StopLiveRecord`, and `DeleteLiveRecord` APIs.
5. Do not create recording tasks and push streams at the same time. After creating a recording task, we recommend you wait at least three seconds before pushing streams.
 * @method Models\CreateScreenshotTaskResponse CreateScreenshotTask(Models\CreateScreenshotTaskRequest $req) This API is used to create a screencapturing task that has a specific start and end time and takes screenshots according to the template configured.
- Note
1. If the stream is interrupted, screencapturing will stop. However, the task will still be valid before the specified end time, and screencapturing will be performed as required after the stream is resumed.
2. Avoid creating screencapturing tasks with overlapping time periods. The system will execute at most three screencapturing tasks on the same stream at a time.
3. Task records are only kept for three months.
4. The new screencapturing APIs (CreateScreenshotTask/StopScreenshotTask/DeleteScreenshotTask) are not compatible with the legacy ones (CreateLiveInstantSnapshot/StopLiveInstantSnapshot). Do not mix them when you call APIs to manage screencapturing tasks.
5. If you create a screencapturing task and publish the stream at the same time, the task may fail to be executed at the specified time. After creating a screencapturing task, we recommend you wait at least three seconds before publishing the stream.

Notes:
This API allows you to query the status of a stream in real time. Given external factors such as network jitter, note the following when you determine whether a host is online:
1. If possible, use your own logic of stream starting/stopping in a room, such as streaming signaling on the client and the online heartbeat of a host, to determine whether the host is online.
2. If your application does not provide the room management feature, use the following methods to determine whether a host is online:
2.1 Use the [live stream callback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/20388?from_cn_redirect=1).
2.2 Call [DescribeLiveStreamOnlineList](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/267/20472?from_cn_redirect=1) on a regular basis (interval > 1 min).
2.3 Call this API.
2.4 A host is considered to be online if the result returned by any of the above methods indicates so. If an API call times out or a parsing error occurs, to minimize the impact on your business, CSS will also consider the host online.

 * @method Models\ModifyLivePlayAuthKeyResponse ModifyLivePlayAuthKey(Models\ModifyLivePlayAuthKeyRequest $req) This API is used to modify the playback authentication key.
 * @method Models\ModifyLivePlayDomainResponse ModifyLivePlayDomain(Models\ModifyLivePlayDomainRequest $req) This API is used to modify a playback domain name.
 * @method Models\ModifyLivePullStreamTaskResponse ModifyLivePullStreamTask(Models\ModifyLivePullStreamTaskRequest $req) This API is used to modify a stream pulling task. 
1. You cannot modify the destination URL. To publish to a new destination, please create a new task.
2. You cannot modify the source type. To use a different source type, please create a new task.
 * @method Models\ModifyLivePushAuthKeyResponse ModifyLivePushAuthKey(Models\ModifyLivePushAuthKeyRequest $req) This API is used to modify the LVB push authentication key.
 * @method Models\ModifyLiveRecordTemplateResponse ModifyLiveRecordTemplate(Models\ModifyLiveRecordTemplateRequest $req) This API is used to modify the recording template configuration.
 * @method Models\ModifyLiveSnapshotTemplateResponse ModifyLiveSnapshotTemplate(Models\ModifyLiveSnapshotTemplateRequest $req) This API is used to modify the screencapturing template configuration.

 * @method Models\RestartLivePullStreamTaskResponse RestartLivePullStreamTask(Models\RestartLivePullStreamTaskRequest $req) Restart the running live streaming pull task.
 * @method Models\ResumeDelayLiveStreamResponse ResumeDelayLiveStream(Models\ResumeDelayLiveStreamRequest $req) This API is used to cancel the delay setting and recover the real-time display of the live streaming image.
 * @method Models\ResumeLiveStreamResponse ResumeLiveStream(Models\ResumeLiveStreamRequest $req) This API is used to resume the push of a specific stream.
 * @method Models\StartLivePadStreamResponse StartLivePadStream(Models\StartLivePadStreamRequest $req) Call this API to switch the live broadcast to standby footage.
 * @method Models\StopLivePadStreamResponse StopLivePadStream(Models\StopLivePadStreamRequest $req) Call this API to end the transition to standby footage.
 * @method Models\StopLiveRecordResponse StopLiveRecord(Models\StopLiveRecordRequest $req) Note: Recording files are stored on the VOD platform.
