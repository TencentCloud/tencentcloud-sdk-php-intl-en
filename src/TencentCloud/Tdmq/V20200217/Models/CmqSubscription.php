 * @method void setMsgCount(integer $MsgCount) Set Number of messages to be delivered in the subscription.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method integer getLastModifyTime() Obtain Time when the subscription attribute is last modified. A Unix timestamp accurate down to the millisecond will be returned.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setLastModifyTime(integer $LastModifyTime) Set Time when the subscription attribute is last modified. A Unix timestamp accurate down to the millisecond will be returned.

 * @method array getBindingKey() Obtain Filtering policy for subscribing to and receiving messages.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setBindingKey(array $BindingKey) Set Filtering policy for subscribing to and receiving messages.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getEndpoint() Obtain Endpoint that receives notifications, which varies by `protocol`: for HTTP, the endpoint must start with `http://`, and the `host` can be a domain or IP; for `queue`, `queueName` should be entered.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setEndpoint(string $Endpoint) Set Endpoint that receives notifications, which varies by `protocol`: for HTTP, the endpoint must start with `http://`, and the `host` can be a domain or IP; for `queue`, `queueName` should be entered.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method array getFilterTags() Obtain Filtering policy selected when a subscription is created:
If `filterType` is 1, `filterTag` will be used for filtering.

Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setFilterTags(array $FilterTags) Set Filtering policy selected when a subscription is created:

 * @method string getProtocol() Obtain Subscription protocol. Currently, two protocols are supported: HTTP and queue. To use the HTTP protocol, you need to build your own web server to receive messages. With the queue protocol, messages are automatically pushed to a CMQ queue and you can pull them concurrently.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setProtocol(string $Protocol) Set Subscription protocol. Currently, two protocols are supported: HTTP and queue. To use the HTTP protocol, you need to build your own web server to receive messages. With the queue protocol, messages are automatically pushed to a CMQ queue and you can pull them concurrently.

 * @method string getNotifyStrategy() Obtain CMQ push server retry policy in case an error occurs while pushing a message to the endpoint. Valid values:
(1) BACKOFF_RETRY: backoff retry, which is to retry at a fixed interval, discard the message after a certain number of retries, and continue to push the next message.
(2) EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY: exponential decay retry, which is to retry at an exponentially increasing interval, such as 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, and so on. As a message can be retained in a topic for one day, failed messages will be discarded at most after one day of retry. Default value: EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setNotifyStrategy(string $NotifyStrategy) Set CMQ push server retry policy in case an error occurs while pushing a message to the endpoint. Valid values:
(1) BACKOFF_RETRY: backoff retry, which is to retry at a fixed interval, discard the message after a certain number of retries, and continue to push the next message.

Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getNotifyContentFormat() Obtain Push content format. Valid values: 1. JSON; 2. SIMPLIFIED, i.e., the raw format. If `protocol` is `queue`, this value must be `SIMPLIFIED`. If `protocol` is `HTTP`, both values are acceptable, and the default value is `JSON`.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setNotifyContentFormat(string $NotifyContentFormat) Set Push content format. Valid values: 1. JSON; 2. SIMPLIFIED, i.e., the raw format. If `protocol` is `queue`, this value must be `SIMPLIFIED`. If `protocol` is `HTTP`, both values are acceptable, and the default value is `JSON`.
