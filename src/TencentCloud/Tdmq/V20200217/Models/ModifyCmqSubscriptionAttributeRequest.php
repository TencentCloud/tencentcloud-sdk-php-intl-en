/**
 * ModifyCmqSubscriptionAttribute request structure.
 *
 * @method string getTopicName() Obtain Topic name, which must be unique in the same topic under the same account in the same region. It can contain up to 64 letters, digits, and hyphens and must begin with a letter.
 * @method void setTopicName(string $TopicName) Set Topic name, which must be unique in the same topic under the same account in the same region. It can contain up to 64 letters, digits, and hyphens and must begin with a letter.
 * @method string getSubscriptionName() Obtain Subscription name, which must be unique in the same topic under the same account in the same region. It can contain up to 64 letters, digits, and hyphens and must begin with a letter.
 * @method void setSubscriptionName(string $SubscriptionName) Set Subscription name, which must be unique in the same topic under the same account in the same region. It can contain up to 64 letters, digits, and hyphens and must begin with a letter.
 * @method string getNotifyStrategy() Obtain CMQ push server retry policy in case an error occurs while pushing a message to the endpoint. Valid values:
(1) BACKOFF_RETRY: backoff retry, which is to retry at a fixed interval, discard the message after a certain number of retries, and continue to push the next message.
(2) EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY: exponential decay retry, which is to retry at an exponentially increasing interval, such as 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, and so on. As a message can be retained in a topic for one day, failed messages will be discarded at most after one day of retry. Default value: EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY.
 * @method void setNotifyStrategy(string $NotifyStrategy) Set CMQ push server retry policy in case an error occurs while pushing a message to the endpoint. Valid values:
(1) BACKOFF_RETRY: backoff retry, which is to retry at a fixed interval, discard the message after a certain number of retries, and continue to push the next message.
(2) EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY: exponential decay retry, which is to retry at an exponentially increasing interval, such as 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, and so on. As a message can be retained in a topic for one day, failed messages will be discarded at most after one day of retry. Default value: EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY.
 * @method string getNotifyContentFormat() Obtain Push content format. Valid values: 1. JSON; 2. SIMPLIFIED, i.e., the raw format. If `Protocol` is `queue`, this value must be `SIMPLIFIED`. If `Protocol` is `HTTP`, both values are acceptable, and the default value is `JSON`.
 * @method void setNotifyContentFormat(string $NotifyContentFormat) Set Push content format. Valid values: 1. JSON; 2. SIMPLIFIED, i.e., the raw format. If `Protocol` is `queue`, this value must be `SIMPLIFIED`. If `Protocol` is `HTTP`, both values are acceptable, and the default value is `JSON`.
 * @method array getFilterTags() Obtain Message body tag (used for message filtering). The number of tags cannot exceed 5, and each tag can contain up to 16 characters. It is used in conjunction with the `MsgTag` parameter of `(Batch)PublishMessage`. Rules: 1. If `FilterTag` is not configured, no matter whether `MsgTag` is configured, the subscription will receive all messages published to the topic; 2. If the array of `FilterTag` values has a value, only when at least one of the values in the array also exists in the array of `MsgTag` values (i.e., `FilterTag` and `MsgTag` have an intersection) can the subscription receive messages published to the topic; 3. If the array of `FilterTag` values has a value, but `MsgTag` is not configured, then no message published to the topic will be received, which can be considered as a special case of rule 2 as `FilterTag` and `MsgTag` do not intersect in this case. The overall design idea of rules is based on the intention of the subscriber.
 * @method void setFilterTags(array $FilterTags) Set Message body tag (used for message filtering). The number of tags cannot exceed 5, and each tag can contain up to 16 characters. It is used in conjunction with the `MsgTag` parameter of `(Batch)PublishMessage`. Rules: 1. If `FilterTag` is not configured, no matter whether `MsgTag` is configured, the subscription will receive all messages published to the topic; 2.

 * @method array getBindingKey() Obtain The number of `BindingKey` cannot exceed 5, and the length of each `BindingKey` cannot exceed 64 bytes. This field indicates the filtering policy for subscribing to and receiving messages. Each `BindingKey` includes up to 15 dots (namely up to 16 segments).
 * @method void setBindingKey(array $BindingKey) Set The number of `BindingKey` cannot exceed 5, and the length of each `BindingKey` cannot exceed 64 bytes. This field indicates the filtering policy for subscribing to and receiving messages. Each `BindingKey` includes up to 15 dots (namely up to 16 segments).
