 * SendMessages request structure.
 *
 * @method string getTopic() Obtain Name of the topic to which to send the message. It is better to be the full path of the topic, such as `tenant/namespace/topic`. If it is not specified, `public/default` will be used by default.
 * @method void setTopic(string $Topic) Set Name of the topic to which to send the message. It is better to be the full path of the topic, such as `tenant/namespace/topic`. If it is not specified, `public/default` will be used by default.
 * @method string getPayload() Obtain Content of the message to be sent
 * @method void setPayload(string $Payload) Set Content of the message to be sent
 * @method string getStringToken() Obtain Token used for authentication, which is optional and will be automatically obtained by the system.
 * @method void setStringToken(string $StringToken) Set Token used for authentication, which is optional and will be automatically obtained by the system.
 * @method string getProducerName() Obtain Producer name, which is randomly generated and must be globally unique. If you set the producer name manually, the producer may fail to be created, causing message sending failure.
This parameter is used only when a specific producer is allowed to produce messages. It won’t be used in most cases.
 * @method void setProducerName(string $ProducerName) Set Producer name, which is randomly generated and must be globally unique. If you set the producer name manually, the producer may fail to be created, causing message sending failure.
This parameter is used only when a specific producer is allowed to produce messages. It won’t be used in most cases.
 * @method integer getSendTimeout() Obtain Message sending timeout period, which is 30s by default.
 * @method void setSendTimeout(integer $SendTimeout) Set Message sending timeout period, which is 30s by default.
 * @method integer getMaxPendingMessages() Obtain Maximum number of produced messages which can be cached in the memory. Default value: 1000
 * @method void setMaxPendingMessages(integer $MaxPendingMessages) Set Maximum number of produced messages which can be cached in the memory. Default value: 1000
