 * @method string getStoreLocation() Obtain COS path of saving querying results
 * @method void setStoreLocation(string $StoreLocation) Set COS path of saving querying results
 * @method boolean getHasLakeFs() Obtain Whether there is permission for managed storage

Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
