data-name: fuzzy search of the database and table.

When the type is EngineAuth, the keys supported are:

policy-type: types of permissions;

policy-source: data sources;

engine-name: fuzzy search of the database and table.
 * @method void setFilters(array $Filters) Set Filter criteria that are queried

When the type is User, the fuzzy search is supported as the key is user-name.
