 * DestroyProxies request structure.

 * @method integer getForce() Obtain The identifier for forced deletion
1: this connection list is deleted forcibly regardless of whether the origin server has been bound.
0: this connection list cannot be deleted if the origin server has been bound.
If this identifier is 0, the deletion can be performed only when all the connections have not been bound to any origin servers.
 * @method void setForce(integer $Force) Set The identifier for forced deletion
1: this connection list is deleted forcibly regardless of whether the origin server has been bound.
0: this connection list cannot be deleted if the origin server has been bound.
If this identifier is 0, the deletion can be performed only when all the connections have not been bound to any origin servers.
 * @method array getInstanceIds() Obtain List of connection instance IDs; It's an old parameter, please switch to ProxyIds.
 * @method void setInstanceIds(array $InstanceIds) Set List of connection instance IDs; It's an old parameter, please switch to ProxyIds.
 * @method string getClientToken() Obtain A string used to ensure the idempotency of the request, which is generated by the user and must be unique to each request. The maximum length is 64 ASCII characters. If this parameter is not specified, the idempotency of the request cannot be guaranteed.
For more information, please see How to Ensure Idempotence.

The maximum length is 64 ASCII characters. If this parameter is not specified, the idempotency of the request cannot be guaranteed.
