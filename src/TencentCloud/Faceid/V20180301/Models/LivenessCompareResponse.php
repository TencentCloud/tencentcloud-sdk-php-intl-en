 * @method string getBestFrameBase64() Obtain The best screenshot of the video after successful verification. The photo is Base64-encoded and in JPG format.
 * @method void setBestFrameBase64(string $BestFrameBase64) Set The best screenshot of the video after successful verification. The photo is Base64-encoded and in JPG format.

As a recommendation, when the similarity is greater than or equal to 70, it can be determined that the two faces are of the same person. You can adjust the threshold according to your specific scenario (the FAR at the threshold of 70 is 0.1%, and FAR at the threshold of 80 is 0.01%).

As a recommendation, when the similarity is greater than or equal to 70, it can be determined that the two faces are of the same person. You can adjust the threshold according to your specific scenario (the FAR at the threshold of 70 is 0.1%, and FAR at the threshold of 80 is 0.01%).
 * @method string getResult() Obtain Service error code. `Success` will be returned for success. For error information, please see the `FailedOperation` section in the error code list below.
