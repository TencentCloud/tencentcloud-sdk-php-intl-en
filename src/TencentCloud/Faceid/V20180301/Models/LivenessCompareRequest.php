 * LivenessCompare request structure.
 *
 * @method string getLivenessType() Obtain Liveness detection type. Valid values: LIP/ACTION/SILENT.
LIP: numeric mode; ACTION: motion mode; SILENT: silent mode. You need to select a mode to input.
 * @method void setLivenessType(string $LivenessType) Set Liveness detection type. Valid values: LIP/ACTION/SILENT.
LIP: numeric mode; ACTION: motion mode; SILENT: silent mode. You need to select a mode to input.
 * @method string getImageBase64() Obtain Base64 string of the image for face comparison.
The size of the Base64-encoded image data can be up to 3 MB. JPG and PNG formats are supported.
Please use the standard Base64 encoding scheme (with the "=" padding). For the encoding conventions, please see RFC 4648.

Either the `ImageUrl` or `ImageBase64` of the image must be provided. If both are provided, only `ImageBase64` will be used.
 * @method void setImageBase64(string $ImageBase64) Set Base64 string of the image for face comparison.
The size of the Base64-encoded image data can be up to 3 MB. JPG and PNG formats are supported.
Please use the standard Base64 encoding scheme (with the "=" padding). For the encoding conventions, please see RFC 4648.

Either the `ImageUrl` or `ImageBase64` of the image must be provided. If both are provided, only `ImageBase64` will be used.
 * @method string getImageUrl() Obtain URL of the image for face comparison. The size of the downloaded image after Base64 encoding can be up to 3 MB. JPG and PNG formats are supported.

Either the `ImageUrl` or `ImageBase64` of the image must be provided. If both are provided, only `ImageBase64` will be used.

We recommend you store the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
 * @method void setImageUrl(string $ImageUrl) Set URL of the image for face comparison. The size of the downloaded image after Base64 encoding can be up to 3 MB. JPG and PNG formats are supported.

Either the `ImageUrl` or `ImageBase64` of the image must be provided. If both are provided, only `ImageBase64` will be used.

 * @method string getValidateData() Obtain Lip mode: set this parameter to a custom 4-digit verification code.
Action mode: set this parameter to a custom action sequence (e.g., `2,1` or `1,2`).
Silent mode: do not pass in this parameter.
 * @method void setValidateData(string $ValidateData) Set Lip mode: set this parameter to a custom 4-digit verification code.
Action mode: set this parameter to a custom action sequence (e.g., `2,1` or `1,2`).
Silent mode: do not pass in this parameter.
 * @method string getOptional() Obtain Optional configuration (a JSON string)
