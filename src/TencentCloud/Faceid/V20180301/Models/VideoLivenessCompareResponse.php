 * VideoLivenessCompare response structure.
 *
 * @method float getSim() Obtain The similarity. Value range: [0.00, 100.00]. As a recommendation, when the similarity is greater than or equal to 70, it can be determined that the two persons are of the same person. You can adjust the threshold according to your specific scenario (the FARs at the thresholds of 70 and 80 are 0.1% and 0.01%, respectively).
 * @method void setSim(float $Sim) Set The similarity. Value range: [0.00, 100.00]. As a recommendation, when the similarity is greater than or equal to 70, it can be determined that the two persons are of the same person. You can adjust the threshold according to your specific scenario (the FARs at the thresholds of 70 and 80 are 0.1% and 0.01%, respectively).
 * @method string getResult() Obtain The service error code. `Success` will be returned for success. For error information, see the `FailedOperation` section in the error code list below.
 * @method void setResult(string $Result) Set The service error code. `Success` will be returned for success. For error information, see the `FailedOperation` section in the error code list below.
 * @method string getDescription() Obtain The service result description
 * @method void setDescription(string $Description) Set The service result description
 * @method FileInfo getBestFrame() Obtain The best video screenshot after successful verification
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setBestFrame(FileInfo $BestFrame) Set The best video screenshot after successful verification
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
