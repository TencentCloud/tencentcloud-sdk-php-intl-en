 * @method void setAttackRiskLevel(string $AttackRiskLevel) Set Whether the detected image is an attack: Low: No attack risk Mid: Moderately suspected attack High: Highly suspected attack
 * @method array getAttackRiskDetailList() Obtain A list of suspected attack traces detected. Note: When no attack traces are detected, an empty array is returned.

 * @method void setExtraInfo(ExtraInfo $ExtraInfo) Set Additional Information
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
