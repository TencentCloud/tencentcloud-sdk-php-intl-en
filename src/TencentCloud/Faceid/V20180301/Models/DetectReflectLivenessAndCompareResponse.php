 * @method string getBestFrameUrl() Obtain Temporary URL of the best screenshot (.jpg) of the video after successful verification. Both the screenshot and the URL are valid for two hours only, so you need to download the screenshot within this period.
 * @method void setBestFrameUrl(string $BestFrameUrl) Set Temporary URL of the best screenshot (.jpg) of the video after successful verification. Both the screenshot and the URL are valid for two hours only, so you need to download the screenshot within this period.
 * @method string getBestFrameMd5() Obtain MD5 hash value (32-bit) of the best screenshot of the video after successful verification, which is used to verify the `BestFrame` consistency.
 * @method void setBestFrameMd5(string $BestFrameMd5) Set MD5 hash value (32-bit) of the best screenshot of the video after successful verification, which is used to verify the `BestFrame` consistency.
 * @method string getResult() Obtain Service error code. `Success` will be returned for success. For error information, see the `FailedOperation` section in the error code list below.
 * @method void setResult(string $Result) Set Service error code. `Success` will be returned for success. For error information, see the `FailedOperation` section in the error code list below.
 * @method string getDescription() Obtain Service result description
 * @method void setDescription(string $Description) Set Service result description
 * @method float getSim() Obtain Similarity. Value range: [0.00, 100.00]. As a recommendation, when the similarity is greater than or equal to 70, it can be determined that the two faces are of the same person. You can adjust the threshold according to your specific scenario (the FAR at the threshold of 70 is 0.1%, and FAR at the threshold of 80 is 0.01%).
 * @method void setSim(float $Sim) Set Similarity. Value range: [0.00, 100.00]. As a recommendation, when the similarity is greater than or equal to 70, it can be determined that the two faces are of the same person. You can adjust the threshold according to your specific scenario (the FAR at the threshold of 70 is 0.1%, and FAR at the threshold of 80 is 0.01%).
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
