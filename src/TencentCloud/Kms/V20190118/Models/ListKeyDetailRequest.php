 * ListKeyDetail request structure.
 *
 * @method integer getOffset() Obtain This parameter has the same meaning of the `Offset` in an SQL query, indicating that this acquisition starts from the "No. Offset value" element of the array arranged in a certain order. The default value is 0.
 * @method void setOffset(integer $Offset) Set This parameter has the same meaning of the `Offset` in an SQL query, indicating that this acquisition starts from the "No. Offset value" element of the array arranged in a certain order. The default value is 0.
 * @method integer getLimit() Obtain This parameter has the same meaning of the `Limit` in an SQL query, indicating that up to `Limit` value elements can be obtained in this request. The default value is 10 and the maximum value is 200.
 * @method void setLimit(integer $Limit) Set This parameter has the same meaning of the `Limit` in an SQL query, indicating that up to `Limit` value elements can be obtained in this request. The default value is 10 and the maximum value is 200.
 * @method integer getRole() Obtain Filters by creator role. 0 (default value): the CMK is created by the user; 1: the CMK is created automatically by an authorized Tencent Cloud service.
 * @method void setRole(integer $Role) Set Filters by creator role. 0 (default value): the CMK is created by the user; 1: the CMK is created automatically by an authorized Tencent Cloud service.
 * @method integer getOrderType() Obtain Sorts by CMK creation time. 0: descending; 1: ascending
 * @method void setOrderType(integer $OrderType) Set Sorts by CMK creation time. 0: descending; 1: ascending
 * @method integer getKeyState() Obtain Filters by CMK status. 0: all CMKs; 1: CMKs in `Enabled` status only; 2: CMKs in `Disabled` status only; 3: CMKs in `PendingDelete` status only (i.e., keys with schedule deletion enabled); 4: CMKs in `PendingImport` status only; 5: CMKs in `Archived` status only.

 * @method void setSearchKeyAlias(string $SearchKeyAlias) Set Performs a fuzzy query by `KeyId` or `Alias`
 * @method string getOrigin() Obtain Filters by CMK type. "TENCENT_KMS" indicates to filter CMKs whose key materials are created by KMS; "EXTERNAL" indicates to filter CMKs of `EXTERNAL` type whose key materials are imported by users; "ALL" or empty indicates to filter CMKs of both types. This value is case-sensitive.
 * @method void setOrigin(string $Origin) Set Filters by CMK type. "TENCENT_KMS" indicates to filter CMKs whose key materials are created by KMS; "EXTERNAL" indicates to filter CMKs of `EXTERNAL` type whose key materials are imported by users; "ALL" or empty indicates to filter CMKs of both types. This value is case-sensitive.
 * @method string getKeyUsage() Obtain Filters by the `KeyUsage` field value. Valid values: `ALL` (all CMKs), `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT` (used when this field is left empty), `ASYMMETRIC_DECRYPT_RSA_2048`, `ASYMMETRIC_DECRYPT_SM2`, `ASYMMETRIC_SIGN_VERIFY_SM2`, `ASYMMETRIC_SIGN_VERIFY_RSA_2048`, and `ASYMMETRIC_SIGN_VERIFY_ECC`.
