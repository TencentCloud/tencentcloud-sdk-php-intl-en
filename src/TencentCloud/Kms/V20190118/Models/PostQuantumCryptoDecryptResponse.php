If `EncryptionPublicKey` is passed in, this field contains the Base64-encoded ciphertext after asymmetric encryption by using the public key in `EncryptionPublicKey` To get the plaintext, you need to first decode the Base64 format, and then decrypwith the private key corresponding with the public key.
