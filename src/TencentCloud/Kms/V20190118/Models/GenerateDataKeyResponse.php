/**
 * GenerateDataKey response structure.
 *
 * @method string getKeyId() Obtain Globally unique CMK ID
 * @method void setKeyId(string $KeyId) Set Globally unique CMK ID
 * @method string getPlaintext() Obtain If `EncryptionPublicKey` is left empty, a Base64-encoded ciphertext will be returned. To get the plaintext, you need to decode the ciphertext first.
If `EncryptionPublicKey` is specified, this field will return the Base64-encoded ciphertext encrypted with the specified public key. To get the plaintext, you need to decode the ciphertext and upload the corresponding private key.
 * @method void setPlaintext(string $Plaintext) Set If `EncryptionPublicKey` is left empty, a Base64-encoded ciphertext will be returned. To get the plaintext, you need to decode the ciphertext first.
If `EncryptionPublicKey` is specified, this field will return the Base64-encoded ciphertext encrypted with the specified public key. To get the plaintext, you need to decode the ciphertext and upload the corresponding private key.
 * @method string getCiphertextBlob() Obtain Ciphertext of the data key, which should be kept by yourself. KMS does not host user data keys. You can call the `Decrypt` API to get the plaintext of the data key from `CiphertextBlob`.
 * @method void setCiphertextBlob(string $CiphertextBlob) Set Ciphertext of the data key, which should be kept by yourself. KMS does not host user data keys. You can call the `Decrypt` API to get the plaintext of the data key from `CiphertextBlob`.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
