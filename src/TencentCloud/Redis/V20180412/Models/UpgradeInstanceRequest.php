/**
 * UpgradeInstance request structure.
 *
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain ID of the instance whose configuration is to be modified. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis速 console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/Redis/instance/list) and copy the instance ID from the instance list.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set ID of the instance whose configuration is to be modified. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis速 console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/Redis/instance/list) and copy the instance ID from the instance list.
 * @method integer getMemSize() Obtain New memory size of an instance shard. <ul><li>Unit: MB. </li><li>You can only modify one of the three parameters at a time: `MemSize`, `RedisShardNum`, and `RedisReplicasNum`. To modify one of them, you need to enter the other two, which are consistent with the original configuration specifications of the instance. </li><li>In case of capacity reduction, the new specification must be at least 1.3 times the used capacity; otherwise, the operation will fail.</li></ul>
 * @method void setMemSize(integer $MemSize) Set New memory size of an instance shard. <ul><li>Unit: MB. </li><li>You can only modify one of the three parameters at a time: `MemSize`, `RedisShardNum`, and `RedisReplicasNum`. To modify one of them, you need to enter the other two, which are consistent with the original configuration specifications of the instance. </li><li>In case of capacity reduction, the new specification must be at least 1.3 times the used capacity; otherwise, the operation will fail.</li></ul>
 * @method integer getRedisShardNum() Obtain New number of instance shards. <ul><li>This parameter is not required for standard architecture instances, but for cluster architecture instances. </li><li>For cluster architecture, you can only modify one of the three parameters at a time: `MemSize`, `RedisShardNum`, and `RedisReplicasNum`. To modify one of them, you need to enter the other two, which are consistent with the original configuration specifications of the instance. </li></ul>
 * @method void setRedisShardNum(integer $RedisShardNum) Set New number of instance shards. <ul><li>This parameter is not required for standard architecture instances, but for cluster architecture instances. </li><li>For cluster architecture, you can only modify one of the three parameters at a time: `MemSize`, `RedisShardNum`, and `RedisReplicasNum`. To modify one of them, you need to enter the other two, which are consistent with the original configuration specifications of the instance. </li></ul>
 * @method integer getRedisReplicasNum() Obtain New replica quantity. <ul><li>You can only modify one of the three parameters at a time: `MemSize`, `RedisShardNum`, and `RedisReplicasNum`. To modify one of them, you need to enter the other two, which are consistent with the original configuration specifications of the instance. </li></ul>To modify the number of replicas in a multi-AZ instance, `NodeSet` must be passed in.</li></ul>
 * @method void setRedisReplicasNum(integer $RedisReplicasNum) Set New replica quantity. <ul><li>You can only modify one of the three parameters at a time: `MemSize`, `RedisShardNum`, and `RedisReplicasNum`. To modify one of them, you need to enter the other two, which are consistent with the original configuration specifications of the instance. </li></ul>To modify the number of replicas in a multi-AZ instance, `NodeSet` must be passed in.</li></ul>
 * @method array getNodeSet() Obtain Node information set when you add a replica for multi-AZ instances, including the ID and AZ information of the replica. This parameter is not required for non-multi-AZ instances.
 * @method void setNodeSet(array $NodeSet) Set Node information set when you add a replica for multi-AZ instances, including the ID and AZ information of the replica. This parameter is not required for non-multi-AZ instances.
 * @method integer getSwitchOption() Obtain Switch time.
 - 1: Perform the operation within the maintenance window: Specification upgrade is executed within the set maintenance window. Use the API [DescribeMaintenanceWindow](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/46336?from_cn_redirect=1) to query the time period of the set maintenance window. Replica addition/removal, shard addition/removal, and memory capacity expansion/shrinkage are supported within the maintenance window. Specification upgrade within the maintenance window is being gradually tested and published by region. It is already supported in some regions. For urgent integration in regions that do not support it, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to apply for an allowlist.
 -2: Perform the operation immediately: The operation will be performed immediately, without the need to wait for the maintenance window. Operations will be performed immediately by default for the system.
 * @method void setSwitchOption(integer $SwitchOption) Set Switch time.
