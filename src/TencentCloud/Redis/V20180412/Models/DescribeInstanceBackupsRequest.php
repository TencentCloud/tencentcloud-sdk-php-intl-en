/**
 * DescribeInstanceBackups request structure.
 *
 * @method integer getLimit() Obtain Number of backups returned per page. Default value: `20`. Maximum value: `100`.
 * @method void setLimit(integer $Limit) Set Number of backups returned per page. Default value: `20`. Maximum value: `100`.
 * @method integer getOffset() Obtain Pagination offset, which is an integral multiple of `Limit`. `offset` = `limit` * (page number - 1).
 * @method void setOffset(integer $Offset) Set Pagination offset, which is an integral multiple of `Limit`. `offset` = `limit` * (page number - 1).
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain ID of the instance to be operated on, which can be obtained through the `InstanceId` field in the return value of the `DescribeInstance` API.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set ID of the instance to be operated on, which can be obtained through the `InstanceId` field in the return value of the `DescribeInstance` API.
 * @method string getBeginTime() Obtain Start time for a query, for example, in the format of 2017-02-08 16:46:34, with a maximum query span of 30 days. You can query the list of instances backed up within the [beginTime, endTime] period.
 * @method void setBeginTime(string $BeginTime) Set Start time for a query, for example, in the format of 2017-02-08 16:46:34, with a maximum query span of 30 days. You can query the list of instances backed up within the [beginTime, endTime] period.
 * @method string getEndTime() Obtain End time for a query, for example, in the format of 2017-02-08 19:09:26, with a maximum query span of 30 days. You can query the list of instances backed up within the [BeginTime, EndTime] period.
 * @method void setEndTime(string $EndTime) Set End time for a query, for example, in the format of 2017-02-08 19:09:26, with a maximum query span of 30 days. You can query the list of instances backed up within the [BeginTime, EndTime] period.
 * @method array getStatus() Obtain Backup task status:
`1`: The backup is in the process.
`2`: The backup is normal.
`3`: The backup is being converted to an RDB file.
`4`: Conversion to RDB has been completed.
`-1`: The backup expired.
`-2`: The backup has been deleted.
 * @method void setStatus(array $Status) Set Backup task status:
`1`: The backup is in the process.
`2`: The backup is normal.
`3`: The backup is being converted to an RDB file.
`4`: Conversion to RDB has been completed.
`-1`: The backup expired.
`-2`: The backup has been deleted.
 * @method string getInstanceName() Obtain Instance name, which can be fuzzily searched.
 * @method void setInstanceName(string $InstanceName) Set Instance name, which can be fuzzily searched.
