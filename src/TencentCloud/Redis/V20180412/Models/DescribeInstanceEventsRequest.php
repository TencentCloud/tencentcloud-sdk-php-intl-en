 * DescribeInstanceEvents request structure.
 *
 * @method string getExecutionStartDate() Obtain Start date for querying the event execution plan, with a maximum query span of 30 days.
 * @method void setExecutionStartDate(string $ExecutionStartDate) Set Start date for querying the event execution plan, with a maximum query span of 30 days.
 * @method string getExecutionEndDate() Obtain End date for querying the event execution plan, with a maximum query span of 30 days.
 * @method void setExecutionEndDate(string $ExecutionEndDate) Set End date for querying the event execution plan, with a maximum query span of 30 days.
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Specifies the instance ID. Example: crs-xjhsdj****. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis) and copy the instance ID in the instance list.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Specifies the instance ID. Example: crs-xjhsdj****. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis) and copy the instance ID in the instance list.
 * @method integer getPageSize() Obtain Outputs the number of events displayed per page.
- Default value: 10.
- Value range: [1, 100].
 * @method void setPageSize(integer $PageSize) Set Outputs the number of events displayed per page.
- Default value: 10.
- Value range: [1, 100].
 * @method integer getPageNo() Obtain Configures the output page number for querying events. You can query events on a certain page by specifying PageNo (page number) and PageSize (number of output results per page).
- Default value: 1.
- Value range: positive integers greater than 0.
 * @method void setPageNo(integer $PageNo) Set Configures the output page number for querying events. You can query events on a certain page by specifying PageNo (page number) and PageSize (number of output results per page).
- Default value: 1.
- Value range: positive integers greater than 0.
 * @method array getStatus() Obtain Current status of the event.- Waiting: The event is waiting for execution on the execution date or during the operations period.- Running: The event is being executed during the operations period.- Finished: Execution of the event is completed.- Canceled: Execution of the event is canceled.
 * @method void setStatus(array $Status) Set Current status of the event.- Waiting: The event is waiting for execution on the execution date or during the operations period.- Running: The event is being executed during the operations period.- Finished: Execution of the event is completed.- Canceled: Execution of the event is canceled.
 * @method array getEventTypes() Obtain Event type. Currently, the type can only be related to instance migration, resource movement, and IDC deletion. This parameter can be set only to **InstanceMigration**.
 * @method void setEventTypes(array $EventTypes) Set Event type. Currently, the type can only be related to instance migration, resource movement, and IDC deletion. This parameter can be set only to **InstanceMigration**.
 * @method array getGrades() Obtain Configures the level of the queried event. Events are divided into Critical, High, Medium, and Low events according to the severity and urgency.- Critical- High- Medium- Low
 * @method void setGrades(array $Grades) Set Configures the level of the queried event. Events are divided into Critical, High, Medium, and Low events according to the severity and urgency.- Critical- High- Medium- Low
