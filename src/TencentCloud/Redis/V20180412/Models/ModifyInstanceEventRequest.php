 * ModifyInstanceEvent request structure.
 *
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Specifies the instance ID. Example: crs-xjhsdj****. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis#/) and copy the instance ID in the instance list.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Specifies the instance ID. Example: crs-xjhsdj****. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis#/) and copy the instance ID in the instance list.
 * @method integer getEventId() Obtain Event ID. Obtain the ID of the event to be modified using DescribeInstanceEvents.
 * @method void setEventId(integer $EventId) Set Event ID. Obtain the ID of the event to be modified using DescribeInstanceEvents.
 * @method string getStartTime() Obtain Modifies the scheduled start time of event execution.
 * @method void setStartTime(string $StartTime) Set Modifies the scheduled start time of event execution.
 * @method string getEndTime() Obtain Modifies the scheduled end time of event execution. After the start time is configured, the end time can only be 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, or 3 hours later than the start time.
 * @method void setEndTime(string $EndTime) Set Modifies the scheduled end time of event execution. After the start time is configured, the end time can only be 30 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, or 3 hours later than the start time.
 * @method string getExecutionDate() Obtain Modifies the start date of the event execution schedule.
 * @method void setExecutionDate(string $ExecutionDate) Set Modifies the start date of the event execution schedule.
 * @method string getStatus() Obtain Modifies the running status of the event. Currently, this parameter can be set only to **Canceled**, indicating that the execution of the current event is canceled. You can query the running status and level of the current event using DescribeInstanceEvents.- Critical or High events cannot be canceled, which means that they must be executed.- Only events in the Waiting state (to be executed) can be canceled.
 * @method void setStatus(string $Status) Set Modifies the running status of the event. Currently, this parameter can be set only to **Canceled**, indicating that the execution of the current event is canceled. You can query the running status and level of the current event using DescribeInstanceEvents.- Critical or High events cannot be canceled, which means that they must be executed.- Only events in the Waiting state (to be executed) can be canceled.
