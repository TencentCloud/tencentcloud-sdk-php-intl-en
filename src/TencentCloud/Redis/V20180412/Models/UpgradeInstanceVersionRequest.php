 * UpgradeInstanceVersion request structure.

 * @method string getTargetInstanceType() Obtain Target instance type after the change, which is the same as the `TypeId` of the [CreateInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/239/20026?from_cn_redirect=1) API.
- For Redis 4.0 or later, a standard architecture instance can be upgraded to a cluster architecture instance on the same version; for example, you can upgrade from Redis 4.0 Standard Architecture to Redis 4.0 Cluster Architecture.
- Cross-version architecture upgrade is not supported; for example, you cannot upgrade from Redis 4.0 Standard Architecture to Redis 5.0 Cluster Architecture.
- The architecture of Redis 2.8 cannot be upgraded.
- Cluster architecture cannot be downgraded to standard architecture.

 * @method void setTargetInstanceType(string $TargetInstanceType) Set Target instance type after the change, which is the same as the `TypeId` of the [CreateInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/239/20026?from_cn_redirect=1) API.
- For Redis 4.0 or later, a standard architecture instance can be upgraded to a cluster architecture instance on the same version; for example, you can upgrade from Redis 4.0 Standard Architecture to Redis 4.0 Cluster Architecture.

- The architecture of Redis 2.8 cannot be upgraded.
- Cluster architecture cannot be downgraded to standard architecture.

 * @method integer getSwitchOption() Obtain Switch time. Valid values:
- `1`: Switch in the maintenance time.
- `2` (default value): Switch now.
 * @method void setSwitchOption(integer $SwitchOption) Set Switch time. Valid values:
- `1`: Switch in the maintenance time.
- `2` (default value): Switch now.
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain ID of the specified instance, such as `crs-xjhsdj****`. Log in to the [Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis#/), and copy it in the instance list.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set ID of the specified instance, such as `crs-xjhsdj****`. Log in to the [Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis#/), and copy it in the instance list.
