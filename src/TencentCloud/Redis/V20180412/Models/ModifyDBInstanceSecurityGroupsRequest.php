 * @method array getSecurityGroupIds() Obtain Replaces with the new security group ID list, which is an array of one or more security group IDs.
- To configure a security group for an instance for the first time, call the API [AssociateSecurityGroups](https://www.tencentcloud.comom/document/product/239/41260?from_cn_redirect=1) to bind a security group first.
- To replace the security group, obtain the security group ID on the [security group](https://console.tencentcloud.com/vpc/security-group) page of the console.

**Note:** This input parameter performs a full replacement on all existing collections but not an incremental update. To modify it, import the expected full collections.
 * @method void setSecurityGroupIds(array $SecurityGroupIds) Set Replaces with the new security group ID list, which is an array of one or more security group IDs.
