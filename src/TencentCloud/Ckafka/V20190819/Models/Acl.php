 * @method void setResourceType(integer $ResourceType) Set ACL resource type. 0: UNKNOWN, 1: ANY, 2: TOPIC, 3: GROUP, 4: CLUSTER, 5: TRANSACTIONAL_ID. Currently, only `TOPIC` is available,
 * @method string getResourceName() Obtain Resource name, which is related to `resourceType`. For example, if `resourceType` is `TOPIC`, this field indicates the topic name; if `resourceType` is `GROUP`, this field indicates the group name
 * @method void setResourceName(string $ResourceName) Set Resource name, which is related to `resourceType`. For example, if `resourceType` is `TOPIC`, this field indicates the topic name; if `resourceType` is `GROUP`, this field indicates the group name
 * @method string getPrincipal() Obtain User list. The default value is `User:*`, which means that any user can access. The current user can only be one included in the user list
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setPrincipal(string $Principal) Set User list. The default value is `User:*`, which means that any user can access. The current user can only be one included in the user list
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getHost() Obtain The default value is `*`, which means that any host can access. Currently, CKafka does not support the host as `*`, but the future product based on the open-source Kafka will directly support this
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
