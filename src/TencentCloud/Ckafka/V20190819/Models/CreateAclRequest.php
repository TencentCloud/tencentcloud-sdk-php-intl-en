 * CreateAcl request structure.
 *
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Instance ID information
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Instance ID information
 * @method integer getResourceType() Obtain ACL resource type (`2`: TOPIC, `3`: GROUP, `4`: CLUSTER).
 * @method void setResourceType(integer $ResourceType) Set ACL resource type (`2`: TOPIC, `3`: GROUP, `4`: CLUSTER).
 * @method integer getOperation() Obtain ACL operation type (`2`: ALL, `3`: READ, `4`: WRITE, `5`: CREATE, `6`: DELETE, `7`: ALTER, `8`: DESCRIBE, `9`: CLUSTER_ACTION, `10`: DESCRIBE_CONFIGS, `11`: ALTER_CONFIGS, `12`: IDEMPOTENT_WRITE).
 * @method void setOperation(integer $Operation) Set ACL operation type (`2`: ALL, `3`: READ, `4`: WRITE, `5`: CREATE, `6`: DELETE, `7`: ALTER, `8`: DESCRIBE, `9`: CLUSTER_ACTION, `10`: DESCRIBE_CONFIGS, `11`: ALTER_CONFIGS, `12`: IDEMPOTENT_WRITE).
 * @method integer getPermissionType() Obtain Permission type (`2`: DENY, `3`: ALLOW). CKafka currently supports `ALLOW`, which is equivalent to allowlist. `DENY` will be supported for ACLs compatible with open-source Kafka.
 * @method void setPermissionType(integer $PermissionType) Set Permission type (`2`: DENY, `3`: ALLOW). CKafka currently supports `ALLOW`, which is equivalent to allowlist. `DENY` will be supported for ACLs compatible with open-source Kafka.
 * @method string getResourceName() Obtain Resource name, which is related to `resourceType`. For example, if `resourceType` is `TOPIC`, this field indicates the topic name; if `resourceType` is `GROUP`, this field indicates the group name; if `resourceType` is `CLUSTER`, this field can be left empty.
 * @method void setResourceName(string $ResourceName) Set Resource name, which is related to `resourceType`. For example, if `resourceType` is `TOPIC`, this field indicates the topic name; if `resourceType` is `GROUP`, this field indicates the group name; if `resourceType` is `CLUSTER`, this field can be left empty.
 * @method string getHost() Obtain The default value is `*`, which means that any host can access. Currently, CKafka does not support the host as `*`, but the future product based on the open-source Kafka will directly support this
 * @method void setHost(string $Host) Set The default value is `*`, which means that any host can access. Currently, CKafka does not support the host as `*`, but the future product based on the open-source Kafka will directly support this
 * @method string getPrincipal() Obtain The list of users allowed to access the topic. Default: User:*, meaning all users. The current user must be in the user list. Add `User:` before the user name (`User:A` for example).
 * @method void setPrincipal(string $Principal) Set The list of users allowed to access the topic. Default: User:*, meaning all users. The current user must be in the user list. Add `User:` before the user name (`User:A` for example).
 * @method string getResourceNameList() Obtain The resource name list, which is in JSON string format. Either `ResourceName` or `resourceNameList` can be specified.
 * @method void setResourceNameList(string $ResourceNameList) Set The resource name list, which is in JSON string format. Either `ResourceName` or `resourceNameList` can be specified.
