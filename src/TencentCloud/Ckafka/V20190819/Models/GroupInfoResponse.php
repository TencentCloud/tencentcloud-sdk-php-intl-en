 * @method string getErrorCode() Obtain Error code. 0: success

Dead: the consumer group does not exist
Empty: there are currently no consumer subscriptions in the consumer group
PreparingRebalance: the consumer group is currently in `rebalance` state
CompletingRebalance: the consumer group is currently in `rebalance` state

Dead: the consumer group does not exist
Empty: there are currently no consumer subscriptions in the consumer group
PreparingRebalance: the consumer group is currently in `rebalance` state
CompletingRebalance: the consumer group is currently in `rebalance` state
Stable: each consumer in the consumer group has joined and is in stable state
 * @method string getProtocolType() Obtain The type of protocol selected by the consumer group, which is `consumer` for common consumers.

However, some systems use their own protocols; for example, the protocol used by kafka-connect is `connect`. Only with the standard `consumer` protocol can this API get to know the specific assigning method and parse the specific partition assignment
