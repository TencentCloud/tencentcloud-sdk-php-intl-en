 * UploadUpdateCertificateInstance response structure.
 *
 * @method integer getDeployRecordId() Obtain The tencent cloud resource update task ID. DeployRecordId equals 0 indicates the task is in progress. Repeatedly request this API, and when DeployRecordId is greater than 0, it means the task has been successfully created. If not successfully created, an exception will be thrown.
 * @method void setDeployRecordId(integer $DeployRecordId) Set The tencent cloud resource update task ID. DeployRecordId equals 0 indicates the task is in progress. Repeatedly request this API, and when DeployRecordId is greater than 0, it means the task has been successfully created. If not successfully created, an exception will be thrown.
 * @method integer getDeployStatus() Obtain Update task creation status: 1 indicates successful creation; 0 indicates an existing ongoing update task, and no new update task was created. The return value DeployRecordId represents the ID of the ongoing update task.
 * @method void setDeployStatus(integer $DeployStatus) Set Update task creation status: 1 indicates successful creation; 0 indicates an existing ongoing update task, and no new update task was created. The return value DeployRecordId represents the ID of the ongoing update task.
 * @method array getUpdateSyncProgress() Obtain Create progress details for asynchronous update tasks.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setUpdateSyncProgress(array $UpdateSyncProgress) Set Create progress details for asynchronous update tasks.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
