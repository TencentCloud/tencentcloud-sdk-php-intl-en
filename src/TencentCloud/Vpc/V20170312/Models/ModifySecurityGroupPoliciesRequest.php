 * ModifySecurityGroupPolicies request structure.
 *
 * @method string getSecurityGroupId() Obtain The security group instance ID, such as `sg-33ocnj9n`. This can be obtained through DescribeSecurityGroups.
 * @method void setSecurityGroupId(string $SecurityGroupId) Set The security group instance ID, such as `sg-33ocnj9n`. This can be obtained through DescribeSecurityGroups.
 * @method SecurityGroupPolicySet getSecurityGroupPolicySet() Obtain The security group policy set. SecurityGroupPolicySet object must specify new egress and ingress policies at the same time. SecurityGroupPolicy object does not support custom index (PolicyIndex).
 * @method void setSecurityGroupPolicySet(SecurityGroupPolicySet $SecurityGroupPolicySet) Set The security group policy set. SecurityGroupPolicySet object must specify new egress and ingress policies at the same time. SecurityGroupPolicy object does not support custom index (PolicyIndex).
 * @method boolean getSortPolicys() Obtain Whether the security group rule is sorted. Default value: False. If it is set to `True`, security group rules will be strictly sorted according to the sequence specified in the `SecurityGroupPolicySet` parameter. Manual entry may cause omission, so we recommend sorting security group rules in the console.
 * @method void setSortPolicys(boolean $SortPolicys) Set Whether the security group rule is sorted. Default value: False. If it is set to `True`, security group rules will be strictly sorted according to the sequence specified in the `SecurityGroupPolicySet` parameter. Manual entry may cause omission, so we recommend sorting security group rules in the console.
