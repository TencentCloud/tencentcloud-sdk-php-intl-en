 * Routing policy object
 *
 * @method string getDestinationCidrBlock() Obtain Destination IP range, such as 112.20.51.0/24. Values cannot be in the VPC IP range.
 * @method void setDestinationCidrBlock(string $DestinationCidrBlock) Set Destination IP range, such as 112.20.51.0/24. Values cannot be in the VPC IP range.
 * @method string getGatewayType() Obtain Type of the next hop. Valid values:
`CVM`: public gateway CVM;
`VPN`: VPN gateway;
`DIRECTCONNECT`: direct connect gateway;
`PEERCONNECTION`: peering connection;
`HAVIP`: HAVIP;
`NAT`: NAT Gateway; 
`NORMAL_CVM`: normal CVM;
`EIP`: public IP address of the CVM;
`LOCAL_GATEWAY`: local gateway.
 * @method void setGatewayType(string $GatewayType) Set Type of the next hop. Valid values:
`CVM`: public gateway CVM;
`VPN`: VPN gateway;
`DIRECTCONNECT`: direct connect gateway;
`PEERCONNECTION`: peering connection;
`HAVIP`: HAVIP;
`NAT`: NAT Gateway; 
`NORMAL_CVM`: normal CVM;
`EIP`: public IP address of the CVM;
`LOCAL_GATEWAY`: local gateway.
 * @method string getGatewayId() Obtain Next hop address. You simply need to specify the gateway ID of a different next hop type, and the system will automatically match the next hop address. 
Note: If `GatewayType` is set to `NORMAL_CVM`, `GatewayId` should be the private IP of the instance.
 * @method void setGatewayId(string $GatewayId) Set Next hop address. You simply need to specify the gateway ID of a different next hop type, and the system will automatically match the next hop address. 
Note: If `GatewayType` is set to `NORMAL_CVM`, `GatewayId` should be the private IP of the instance.
 * @method integer getRouteId() Obtain Routing policy ID. The IPv4 routing policy will have a meaningful value, while the IPv6 routing policy is always 0. We recommend using the unique ID `RouteItemId` for the routing policy.
This field is required when you want to delete a routing policy.
 * @method void setRouteId(integer $RouteId) Set Routing policy ID. The IPv4 routing policy will have a meaningful value, while the IPv6 routing policy is always 0. We recommend using the unique ID `RouteItemId` for the routing policy.
This field is required when you want to delete a routing policy.
 * @method string getRouteDescription() Obtain The description of the routing policy.
 * @method void setRouteDescription(string $RouteDescription) Set The description of the routing policy.
 * @method boolean getEnabled() Obtain Whether it is enabled
 * @method void setEnabled(boolean $Enabled) Set Whether it is enabled
 * @method string getRouteType() Obtain The route type. Currently, the following types are supported:
USER: User route;
NETD: Network probe route. When creating a network probe route, the system delivers by default. It cannot be edited or deleted;
CCN: CCN route. The system delivers by default. It cannot be edited or deleted.
Users can only add and operate USER-type routes.
 * @method void setRouteType(string $RouteType) Set The route type. Currently, the following types are supported:
USER: User route;
NETD: Network probe route. When creating a network probe route, the system delivers by default. It cannot be edited or deleted;
CCN: CCN route. The system delivers by default. It cannot be edited or deleted.
Users can only add and operate USER-type routes.
 * @method string getRouteTableId() Obtain Route table instance ID, such as rtb-azd4dt1c.
 * @method void setRouteTableId(string $RouteTableId) Set Route table instance ID, such as rtb-azd4dt1c.
 * @method string getDestinationIpv6CidrBlock() Obtain Destination IPv6 IP range, which cannot be included in VPC IP range, such as 2402:4e00:1000:810b::/64.
 * @method void setDestinationIpv6CidrBlock(string $DestinationIpv6CidrBlock) Set Destination IPv6 IP range, which cannot be included in VPC IP range, such as 2402:4e00:1000:810b::/64.
 * @method string getRouteItemId() Obtain Unique routing policy ID.
 * @method void setRouteItemId(string $RouteItemId) Set Unique routing policy ID.
 * @method boolean getPublishedToVbc() Obtain Whether the routing policy is published to CCN.
Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setPublishedToVbc(boolean $PublishedToVbc) Set Whether the routing policy is published to CCN.
Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getCreatedTime() Obtain Creation time of the routing policy
 * @method void setCreatedTime(string $CreatedTime) Set Creation time of the routing policy
