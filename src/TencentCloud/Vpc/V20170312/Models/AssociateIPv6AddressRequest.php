If NetworkInterfaceId is specified, PrivateIPv6Address must also be specified, which indicates that the EIP will be bound to the specified private IPv6 of the specified ENI. At the same time, it shall be ensured that the specified PrivateIPv6Address is a private IPv6 on the specified NetworkInterfaceId. The specified ENI's private IPv6 can be queried by logging in to the console or obtained from the Ipv6AddressSet.Address field in the returned value of the DescribeNetworkInterfaces API.
