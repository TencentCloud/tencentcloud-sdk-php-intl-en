 * CreateSubnet request structure.
 *
 * @method string getVpcId() Obtain The ID of the VPC instance to be operated on. You can obtain the parameter value from the VpcId field in the returned result of DescribeVpcs API.
 * @method void setVpcId(string $VpcId) Set The ID of the VPC instance to be operated on. You can obtain the parameter value from the VpcId field in the returned result of DescribeVpcs API.
 * @method string getSubnetName() Obtain The subnet name. The maximum length is 60 bytes.
 * @method void setSubnetName(string $SubnetName) Set The subnet name. The maximum length is 60 bytes.
 * @method string getCidrBlock() Obtain The subnet IP address range. It must be within the VPC IP address range. Subnet IP address ranges cannot overlap with each other within the same VPC.
 * @method void setCidrBlock(string $CidrBlock) Set The subnet IP address range. It must be within the VPC IP address range. Subnet IP address ranges cannot overlap with each other within the same VPC.
 * @method string getZone() Obtain The ID of the availability zone in which the subnet resides. You can set up disaster recovery across availability zones by choosing different availability zones for different subnets.
 * @method void setZone(string $Zone) Set The ID of the availability zone in which the subnet resides. You can set up disaster recovery across availability zones by choosing different availability zones for different subnets.
 * @method array getTags() Obtain Bound tags, such as [{"Key": "city", "Value": "shanghai"}].
 * @method void setTags(array $Tags) Set Bound tags, such as [{"Key": "city", "Value": "shanghai"}].
 * @method string getCdcId() Obtain CDC instance ID
