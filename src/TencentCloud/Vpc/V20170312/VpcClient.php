 * @method Models\AssignIpv6SubnetCidrBlockResponse AssignIpv6SubnetCidrBlock(Models\AssignIpv6SubnetCidrBlockRequest $req) This API (AssignIpv6SubnetCidrBlock) is used to assign IPv6 subnet IP ranges.
* To assign an `IPv6` IP range to a subnet, the `VPC` that the subnet belongs to should have obtained the `IPv6` IP range. If this has not been assigned, use the `AssignIpv6CidrBlock` API to assign an `IPv6` IP range to the `VPC` to which the subnet belongs. Otherwise, the `IPv6` subnet IP range cannot be assigned.
* Each subnet can only be assigned one IPv6 IP range.
 * @method Models\AssignPrivateIpAddressesResponse AssignPrivateIpAddresses(Models\AssignPrivateIpAddressesRequest $req) This API is used to apply for private IPs for an ENI.
* An ENI can only be bound with a limited number of IP addresses. For more information about resource limits, see <a href="/document/product/576/18527">ENI Use Limits</a>.
* You can apply for a specified private IP. It cannot be a primary IP because the primary IP already exists and cannot be modified. The private IP address must be an idle IP in the subnet to which the ENI belongs.
* You can apply for more than one secondary private IP on the ENI. The API will return the specified number of secondary private IPs in the subnet IP range.

<li>When creating the `Egress` and `Ingress` polices,<ul>
<li>`Protocol`: Allows `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, `ICMPV6`, `GRE` and `ALL`.</li>
<li>`CidrBlock`: For the classic network, the `CidrBlock` can contain private IPs of Tencent Cloud resources that are not under your account. It does not mean that you can access these devices. The network isolation policies between tenants take priority over the private network policies in security groups.</li>
<li>`Ipv6CidrBlock`: For the classic network, `Ipv6CidrBlock` can contain private IPv6 addresses of Tencent Cloud resources that are not under your account. It does not mean that you can access these devices. The network isolation policies between tenants take priority over the private network policies in security groups.</li>
<li>`SecurityGroupId`: ID of the security group to create policies. </li>
<li>`Port`: A single port (“80”) or a port range ("8000-8010"). This parameter is only available when `Protocol` is `TCP` or `UDP`.</li>
<li>`Action`: `ACCEPT` or `DROP`.</li>
<li><code>CidrBlock</code>, <code>Ipv6CidrBlock</code>, <code>SecurityGroupId</code>, and <code>AddressTemplate</code> are mutually exclusive. <code>Protocol</code> + <code>Port</code> and <code>ServiceTemplate</code> are mutually exclusive. <code>IPv6CidrBlock</code> and <code>ICMP</code> are mutually exclusive; to use them, enter <code>ICMPV6</code>.</li>
<li>You can only create policies in one direction in each request. To specify the `PolicyIndex` parameter, use the same index number in policies. If you want to insert a rule before the first rule, enter 0; if you want to add a rule after the last rule, leave it empty.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
 * @method Models\CreateSecurityGroupWithPoliciesResponse CreateSecurityGroupWithPolicies(Models\CreateSecurityGroupWithPoliciesRequest $req) This API is used to create a security group, and add security group policies.
* For the the upper limit of security groups per project in each region under each account, <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12453?from_cn_redirect=1">see here</a>
* For newly created security groups, the inbound and outbound policies are set to `Deny All` by default. You need to call <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/15807?from_cn_redirect=1">CreateSecurityGroupPolicies</a>
to change it.

Description:
* `Version`: The version number of a security group policy. It automatically increments by 1 every time you update the security policy, so to prevent the expiration of the updated policies. If this field is left empty, any conflicts will be ignored.
* `Protocol`: Values can be `TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`, `ICMPV6`, `GRE`, and `ALL`.
* `CidrBlock`: Enter a CIDR block in the correct format. In the classic network, even if the CIDR block specified in `CidrBlock` contains the Tencent Cloud private IPs not used for CVMs under your Tencent Cloud account, it does not mean this policy allows you to access those resources. The network isolation policies between tenants take priority over the private network policies in security groups.
* `Ipv6CidrBlock`: Enter an IPv6 CIDR block in the correct format. In the classic network, even if the CIDR block specified in `Ipv6CidrBlock` contains the Tencent Cloud private IPv6 addresses not used for CVMs under your Tencent Cloud account, it does not mean this policy allows you to access those resources. The network isolation policies between tenants take priority over the private network policies in security groups.
* `SecurityGroupId`: ID of the security group. It can be the ID of a security group to be modified, or the ID of another security group in the same project. All private IPs of all CVMs under the security group will be covered. If this field is used, the policy will automatically change according to the CVM associated with the group ID while being used to match network messages. You don't need to change it manually.
* `Port`: Enter a single port number (such as `80`), or a port range (such as `8000-8010`). `Port` is only applicable when `Protocol` is `TCP` or `UDP`. If `Protocol` is not `TCP` or `UDP`, `Protocol` and `Port` cannot be both specified. 
* `Action`: Values can be `ACCEPT` or `DROP`.
* `CidrBlock`, `Ipv6CidrBlock`, `SecurityGroupId`, and `AddressTemplate` are exclusive to one another. "Protocol + Port" and `ServiceTemplate` are mutually exclusive.
* Only policies in one direction can be created in each request. If you need to specify the `PolicyIndex` parameter, the indexes of policies must be consistent.
