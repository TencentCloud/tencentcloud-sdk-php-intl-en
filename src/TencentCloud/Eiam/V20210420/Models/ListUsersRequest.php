/**
 * ListUsers request structure.
 *
 * @method UserSearchCriteria getSearchCondition() Obtain User attribute search criterion. The supported search criteria include username, mobile number, email address, user locking status, user freezing status, creation time, and last modification time, which can also be combined. In addition, multiple query methods such as full match, partial match, and range match are supported. Specifically, double quotation marks ("") indicate full match, an asterisk (*) at the end of the field indicates partial match, brackets separated by a comma ([Min,Max]) indicate query within a closed interval, braces separated by a comma ({Min,Max}) indicate query within an open interval, and a bracket and a brace can be used together (for example, {Min,Max] indicates that the minimum value is excluded and the maximum value is included in the query). Range query supports using an asterisk (for example, {20,*] indicates an interval including all data greater than 20) and querying by time period. The supported attributes include creation time (CreationTime) and last modification time (LastUpdateTime) in ISO 8601 format, such as `2021-01-13T09:44:07.182+0000`.
 * @method void setSearchCondition(UserSearchCriteria $SearchCondition) Set User attribute search criterion. The supported search criteria include username, mobile number, email address, user locking status, user freezing status, creation time, and last modification time, which can also be combined. In addition, multiple query methods such as full match, partial match, and range match are supported.

 * @method array getExpectedFields() Obtain User attributes expected to be returned. All built-in user attributes will be returned by default, including user UUID (UserId), nickname (DisplayName), username (UserName), mobile number (Phone), email address (Email), status (Status), user group (SubjectGroups), organization path (OrgPath), remarks (Description), creation time (CreationTime), last modification time (LastUpdateTime), and last login time (LastLoginTime).
 * @method void setExpectedFields(array $ExpectedFields) Set User attributes expected to be returned. All built-in user attributes will be returned by default, including user UUID (UserId), nickname (DisplayName), username (UserName), mobile number (Phone), email address (Email), status (Status), user group (SubjectGroups), organization path (OrgPath), remarks (Description), creation time (CreationTime), last modification time (LastUpdateTime), and last login time (LastLoginTime).
 * @method SortCondition getSort() Obtain Set of sort criteria. The supported attributes for sorting include username (UserName), nickname (DisplayName), mobile number (Phone), email address (Email), user status (Status), creation time (CreatedDate), last modification time (LastUpdateTime), and last login time (LastLoginTime). If this field is left empty, the results will be sorted in alphabetical order by nickname (DisplayName).
 * @method void setSort(SortCondition $Sort) Set Set of sort criteria. The supported attributes for sorting include username (UserName), nickname (DisplayName), mobile number (Phone), email address (Email), user status (Status), creation time (CreatedDate), last modification time (LastUpdateTime), and last login time (LastLoginTime). If this field is left empty, the results will be sorted in alphabetical order by nickname (DisplayName).
 * @method integer getOffset() Obtain Pagination offset. Default value: 0. The `Offset` and `Limit` fields need to be used together; otherwise, the query results will not be paginated, and up to 1,000 users will be returned.
 * @method void setOffset(integer $Offset) Set Pagination offset. Default value: 0. The `Offset` and `Limit` fields need to be used together; otherwise, the query results will not be paginated, and up to 1,000 users will be returned.
 * @method integer getLimit() Obtain Number of results read per page. Default value: 50. Maximum value: 100. The `Offset` and `Limit` fields need to be used together; otherwise, the query results will not be paginated, and up to 1,000 users will be returned.
 * @method void setLimit(integer $Limit) Set Number of results read per page. Default value: 50. Maximum value: 100. The `Offset` and `Limit` fields need to be used together; otherwise, the query results will not be paginated, and up to 1,000 users will be returned.
 * @method boolean getIncludeTotal() Obtain Whether to view the total number of search results. Default value: false (no).
 * @method void setIncludeTotal(boolean $IncludeTotal) Set Whether to view the total number of search results. Default value: false (no).
