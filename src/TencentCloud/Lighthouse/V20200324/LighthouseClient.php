<li>Only rollback to the original system disk is supported. </li>
<li>Only snapshots in `NORMAL` status can be used for rollback. To query the status of a snapshot, you can call the `DescribeSnapshots` API and see the `SnapshotState` field in the response.</li>
<li>When a snapshot is rolled back, the status of the instance must be `STOPPED` or `RUNNING`. You can call the `DescribeInstances` API to query the instance status. Instances in `RUNNING` status will be forcibly shut down before snapshot rollback. </li>
