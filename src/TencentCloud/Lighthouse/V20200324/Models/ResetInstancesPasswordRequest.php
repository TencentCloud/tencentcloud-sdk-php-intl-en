 * ResetInstancesPassword request structure.
 *
 * @method array getInstanceIds() Obtain Instance ID list. Each request can contain up to 100 instances at a time.
 * @method void setInstanceIds(array $InstanceIds) Set Instance ID list. Each request can contain up to 100 instances at a time.
 * @method string getPassword() Obtain Login password of the instance(s). The password requirements vary among different operating systems:
The password of a `LINUX_UNIX` instance must contain 8–30 characters (above 12 characters preferably) in at least three of the following types and cannot begin with "/": <br><li>Lowercase letters: [a–z]<br><li>Uppercase letters: [A–Z]<br><li>Digits: 0–9<br><li>Special symbols: ()\`~!@#$%^&\*-+=\_|{}[]:;'<>,.?/</li>
The password of a `WINDOWS` instance must contain 12–30 characters in at least three of the following types and cannot begin with "/" or include the username: <br><li>Lowercase letters: [a–z]<br><li>Uppercase letters: [A–Z]<br><li>Digits: 0–9<br><li>Special symbols: ()\`~!@#$%^&\*-+=\_|{}[]:;' <>,.?/<br><li>If both `LINUX_UNIX` and `WINDOWS` instances exist, the requirements for password complexity of `WINDOWS` instances shall prevail.
 * @method void setPassword(string $Password) Set Login password of the instance(s). The password requirements vary among different operating systems:
The password of a `LINUX_UNIX` instance must contain 8–30 characters (above 12 characters preferably) in at least three of the following types and cannot begin with "/": <br><li>Lowercase letters: [a–z]<br><li>Uppercase letters: [A–Z]<br><li>Digits: 0–9<br><li>Special symbols: ()\`~!@#$%^&\*-+=\_|{}[]:;'<>,.?/</li>

 * @method string getUserName() Obtain OS username of the instance for which you want to reset the password, which can contain up to 64 characters.
