 * @method string getStartTime() Obtain Start time (xxxx-xx-xx), such as `2019-08-14`. It is 7 days ago by default and should not be more than 30 days ago.
 * @method void setStartTime(string $StartTime) Set Start time (xxxx-xx-xx), such as `2019-08-14`. It is 7 days ago by default and should not be more than 30 days ago.
 * @method string getEndTime() Obtain End time (xxxx-xx-xx), such as `2019-08-14`. It is yesterday by default and should not be more than 30 days ago. When the time period between the start time and end time is within 1 day, data at the 1-minute granularity will be returned; when the time period is within 7 days, data at the 5-minute granularity will be returned; otherwise, data at the 1-hour granularity will be returned.
 * @method void setEndTime(string $EndTime) Set End time (xxxx-xx-xx), such as `2019-08-14`. It is yesterday by default and should not be more than 30 days ago. When the time period between the start time and end time is within 1 day, data at the 1-minute granularity will be returned; when the time period is within 7 days, data at the 5-minute granularity will be returned; otherwise, data at the 1-hour granularity will be returned.
 * @method array getFilters() Obtain Filter.

region    String      Required: no     (Filter) Filter by region. Fuzzy match is not supported. Note: you need to enter the ECM region to be queried before data can be returned.
area       String      Required: no     (Filter) Filter by region. Fuzzy match is not supported. Regions include `china-central`, `china-east`, etc. You can call `DescribeNode` to get the information of all regions. You can also use `ALL_REGION` to indicate all regions.
isp         String      Required: no     (Filter) Filter region traffic by ISP. ISPs include CTCC, CUCC, and CMCC. This parameter must be used together with `area`, and you can specify only one ISP at a time.

You can specify either `region` or `area`.
 * @method void setFilters(array $Filters) Set Filter.

region    String      Required: no     (Filter) Filter by region. Fuzzy match is not supported. Note: you need to enter the ECM region to be queried before data can be returned.
area       String      Required: no     (Filter) Filter by region. Fuzzy match is not supported. Regions include `china-central`, `china-east`, etc. You can call `DescribeNode` to get the information of all regions. You can also use `ALL_REGION` to indicate all regions.

You can specify either `region` or `area`.
 * @method integer getPeriod() Obtain Statistical period in seconds. Valid values: 60, 300.
 * @method void setPeriod(integer $Period) Set Statistical period in seconds. Valid values: 60, 300.
