 * @method string getEcmRegion() Obtain ECM region
 * @method void setEcmRegion(string $EcmRegion) Set ECM region
 * @method array getAddressIds() Obtain List of unique IDs of EIPs, such as `eip-11112222`. `AddressIds` and `Filters` cannot be specified at the same time.
 * @method void setAddressIds(array $AddressIds) Set List of unique IDs of EIPs, such as `eip-11112222`. `AddressIds` and `Filters` cannot be specified at the same time.
 * @method array getFilters() Obtain Each request can contain up to 10 `Filters` and 5 `Filter.Values`. `AddressIds` and `Filters` cannot be specified at the same time. The detailed filters are as follows:
address-id - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by unique EIP ID, such as `eip-11112222`.
address-name - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by EIP name. Fuzzy filtering is not supported.
address-ip - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by EIP IP address.
address-status - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by EIP status. Value range: see the list of EIP status.
instance-id - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by the ID of the instance bound to the EIP, such as `ins-11112222`.
private-ip-address - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by the private IP bound to the EIP.
network-interface-id - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by ID of the ENI bound to the EIP, such as `eni-11112222`.
is-arrears - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by whether the EIP is overdue (TRUE: the EIP is overdue | FALSE: the billing status of the EIP is normal)
 * @method void setFilters(array $Filters) Set Each request can contain up to 10 `Filters` and 5 `Filter.Values`. `AddressIds` and `Filters` cannot be specified at the same time. The detailed filters are as follows:

is-arrears - String - Required: no - (Filter) Filter by whether the EIP is overdue (TRUE: the EIP is overdue | FALSE: the billing status of the EIP is normal)
 * @method integer getOffset() Obtain Offset. Default value: 0.
 * @method void setOffset(integer $Offset) Set Offset. Default value: 0.
 * @method integer getLimit() Obtain Number of results to be returned. Default value: 20. Maximum value: 100.
 * @method void setLimit(integer $Limit) Set Number of results to be returned. Default value: 20. Maximum value: 100.
