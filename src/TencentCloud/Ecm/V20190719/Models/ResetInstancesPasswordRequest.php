 * ResetInstancesPassword request structure.
 *
 * @method array getInstanceIdSet() Obtain List of IDs of the instances for which to set the password. You can request up to 100 instances in a region at a time.
 * @method void setInstanceIdSet(array $InstanceIdSet) Set List of IDs of the instances for which to set the password. You can request up to 100 instances in a region at a time.
 * @method string getPassword() Obtain New password. The password of a Linux instance must contain 8–16 characters in at least two of the following character types: letters, digits, and special symbols [( ) ~ ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = _ | { } [ ] : ; ' < > , . ? /] and cannot start with `/`.
The password of a Windows instance must contain 12–16 characters in at least three of the following character types: letters, digits, and special symbols [( ) ~ ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = _ | { } [ ] : ; ' < > , . ? /] and cannot start with `/`.
If the instances include both Linux instances and Windows instances, the password complexity limit for Windows instances will apply.
 * @method void setPassword(string $Password) Set New password. The password of a Linux instance must contain 8–16 characters in at least two of the following character types: letters, digits, and special symbols [( ) ~ ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = _ | { } [ ] : ; ' < > , . ? /] and cannot start with `/`.

 * @method boolean getForceStop() Obtain Whether to force shut down. Default value: false.
 * @method void setForceStop(boolean $ForceStop) Set Whether to force shut down. Default value: false.
 * @method string getUserName() Obtain Username of the instance for which to reset the password, which can contain up to 64 characters. If this parameter is not specified, the password of the root user will be reset by default for Linux, and the password of the admin will be reset by default for Windows.
 * @method void setUserName(string $UserName) Set Username of the instance for which to reset the password, which can contain up to 64 characters.
