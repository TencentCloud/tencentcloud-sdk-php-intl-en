/**
 * CreateGroup request structure.
 *
 * @method string getGroupName() Obtain Group name, which is modifiable, must be unique, and can contain 1 to 60 characters.
 * @method void setGroupName(string $GroupName) Set Group name, which is modifiable, must be unique, and can contain 1 to 60 characters.
 * @method string getGroupId() Obtain Group ID, which is unmodifiable, must be unique, and can contain letters, digits, and special symbols (-%@#&_) of up to 64 B.
 * @method void setGroupId(string $GroupId) Set Group ID, which is unmodifiable, must be unique, and can contain letters, digits, and special symbols (-%@#&_) of up to 64 B.
 * @method array getGroupExDescriptions() Obtain Custom group description field that describes the person attributes in the group, which will be applied to all persons in the group. 
Up to 5 ones can be created. 
Each custom description field can contain 1 to 30 characters. 
The custom description field must be unique in the group. 
Example: if you set the "custom description field" of a group to ["student ID","employee ID","mobile number"], 
then all the persons in the group will have description fields named "student ID", "employee ID", and "mobile number". 
You can enter content in the corresponding field to register a person's student ID, employee ID, and mobile number.
 * @method void setGroupExDescriptions(array $GroupExDescriptions) Set Custom group description field that describes the person attributes in the group, which will be applied to all persons in the group. 
Up to 5 ones can be created. 
Each custom description field can contain 1 to 30 characters. 
The custom description field must be unique in the group. 
Example: if you set the "custom description field" of a group to ["student ID","employee ID","mobile number"], 
then all the persons in the group will have description fields named "student ID", "employee ID", and "mobile number". 
You can enter content in the corresponding field to register a person's student ID, employee ID, and mobile number.
 * @method string getTag() Obtain Group remarks, which can contain 0 to 40 characters.
 * @method void setTag(string $Tag) Set Group remarks, which can contain 0 to 40 characters.
 * @method string getFaceModelVersion() Obtain Algorithm model version used by the Face Recognition service.

Currently, `2.0` and `3.0` are supported.

This parameter is `3.0` by default starting from April 2, 2020. If it is left empty for accounts that used this API, `2.0` will be used by default.

The parameter can be set only to `3.0` for accounts that purchase the service after November 26, 2020.

Different algorithm model versions correspond to different face recognition algorithms. The 3.0 version has a better overall effect than the legacy version and is recommended.
 * @method void setFaceModelVersion(string $FaceModelVersion) Set Algorithm model version used by the Face Recognition service.

Currently, `2.0` and `3.0` are supported.

This parameter is `3.0` by default starting from April 2, 2020. If it is left empty for accounts that used this API, `2.0` will be used by default.
