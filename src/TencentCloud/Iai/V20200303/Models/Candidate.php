 * @method string getPersonId() Obtain Person ID
 * @method void setPersonId(string $PersonId) Set Person ID
 * @method string getFaceId() Obtain Face ID, which is valid only when returned by the `SearchFaces` or `SearchFacesReturnsByGroup` API. User search APIs use facial feature fusion to search for users, for which this field is meaningless.
 * @method void setFaceId(string $FaceId) Set Face ID, which is valid only when returned by the `SearchFaces` or `SearchFacesReturnsByGroup` API. User search APIs use facial feature fusion to search for users, for which this field is meaningless.

In a face base library containing 10,000 faces, the 1%, 0.1%, and 0.01% FARs correspond to scores of 70, 80, and 90, respectively;
In a face base library containing 100,000 faces, the 1%, 0.1%, and 0.01% FARs correspond to scores of 80, 90, and 100, respectively;
In a face base library containing 300,000 faces, the 1% and 0.1% FARs correspond to scores of 85 and 95, respectively.

Generally, the score of 80 is suitable for most scenarios. We recommend choosing an appropriate score based on the actual situation, preferably no more than 90.
 * @method void setScore(float $Score) Set Match score of candidate.
