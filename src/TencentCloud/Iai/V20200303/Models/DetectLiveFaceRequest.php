 * @method string getImage() Obtain Base64-encoded image data, which cannot exceed 5 MB.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats (the aspect ratio of the image should be close to 3:4 (width:height); otherwise, the score returned for the image will be meaningless).
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method void setImage(string $Image) Set Base64-encoded image data, which cannot exceed 5 MB.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats (the aspect ratio of the image should be close to 3:4 (width:height); otherwise, the score returned for the image will be meaningless).
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method string getUrl() Obtain Image URL. The image cannot exceed 5 MB in size after being Base64-encoded.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used. 
(The aspect ratio of the image should be close to 3:4 (width:height); otherwise, the score returned for the image will be meaningless.) 
We recommend storing the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. 
The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method void setUrl(string $Url) Set Image URL. The image cannot exceed 5 MB in size after being Base64-encoded.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used.

The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method string getFaceModelVersion() Obtain Algorithm model version used by the Face Recognition service.

Currently, `2.0` and `3.0` are supported.

This parameter is `3.0` by default starting from April 2, 2020. If it is left empty for accounts that used this API, `2.0` will be used by default.

The parameter can be set only to `3.0` for accounts that purchase the service after November 26, 2020.

Different algorithm model versions correspond to different face recognition algorithms. The 3.0 version has a better overall effect than the legacy version and is recommended.
 * @method void setFaceModelVersion(string $FaceModelVersion) Set Algorithm model version used by the Face Recognition service.

Currently, `2.0` and `3.0` are supported.

This parameter is `3.0` by default starting from April 2, 2020. If it is left empty for accounts that used this API, `2.0` will be used by default.
