/**
 * VerifyFace request structure.
 *
 * @method string getPersonId() Obtain ID of the person to be verified. For more information on `PersonId`, please see the group management APIs.
 * @method void setPersonId(string $PersonId) Set ID of the person to be verified. For more information on `PersonId`, please see the group management APIs.
 * @method string getImage() Obtain Base64-encoded image data, which cannot exceed 5 MB.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
If there are multiple faces in the image, only the face with the largest size will be selected.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method void setImage(string $Image) Set Base64-encoded image data, which cannot exceed 5 MB.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
If there are multiple faces in the image, only the face with the largest size will be selected.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method string getUrl() Obtain Image URL. The image cannot exceed 5 MB in size after being Base64-encoded.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used.  
We recommend storing the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. 
The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
If there are multiple faces in the image, only the face with the largest size will be selected.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method void setUrl(string $Url) Set Image URL. The image cannot exceed 5 MB in size after being Base64-encoded.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used.  
We recommend storing the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. 
The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.

PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method integer getQualityControl() Obtain Image quality control. 
0: no control. 
1: low quality requirement. The image has one or more of the following problems: extreme blurriness, covered eyes, covered nose, and covered mouth. 
2: average quality requirement. The image has at least three of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, blurriness or average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
3: high-quality requirement. The image has one to two of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
4: very high-quality requirement. The image is optimal in all dimensions or only has a slight problem in one dimension. 
Default value: 0. 
If the image quality does not meet the requirement, the returned result will prompt that the detected image quality is unsatisfactory.
 * @method void setQualityControl(integer $QualityControl) Set Image quality control. 
0: no control. 
1: low quality requirement. The image has one or more of the following problems: extreme blurriness, covered eyes, covered nose, and covered mouth. 
2: average quality requirement. The image has at least three of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, blurriness or average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
3: high-quality requirement. The image has one to two of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
4: very high-quality requirement. The image is optimal in all dimensions or only has a slight problem in one dimension. 
Default value: 0. 
If the image quality does not meet the requirement, the returned result will prompt that the detected image quality is unsatisfactory.
 * @method integer getNeedRotateDetection() Obtain Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image will not be rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
 * @method void setNeedRotateDetection(integer $NeedRotateDetection) Set Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image will not be rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
