 * Face quality information, including score, sharpness, brightness, and completeness. Valid information will be returned only if `NeedFaceDetection` is set to 1.
 *
 * @method integer getScore() Obtain Quality score. Value range: [0,100]. It comprehensively evaluates whether the image quality is suitable for face recognition; the higher the score, the higher the quality. 
In normal cases, you only need to use `Score` as the overall quality standard score. Specific item scores such as `Sharpness`, `Brightness`, `Completeness` are for reference only.
Reference range: [0,40]: poor; [40,60]: fine; [60,80]: good; [80,100]: excellent. 
We recommend selecting images with a score above 70 for adding faces.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.

Reference range: [0,30]: dark; [30,70]: normal; [70,100]: bright. 
We recommend selecting images in the [30,70] range for adding faces.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
