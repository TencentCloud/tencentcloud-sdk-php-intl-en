/**
 * Face information list.
 *
 * @method integer getX() Obtain Horizontal coordinate of the top-left vertex of the face frame.
The face frame encompasses the facial features and is extended accordingly. If it is larger than the image, the coordinates will be negative. 
If you want to capture a complete face, you can set the negative coordinates to 0 if the `completeness` score meets the requirement.
 * @method void setX(integer $X) Set Horizontal coordinate of the top-left vertex of the face frame.
The face frame encompasses the facial features and is extended accordingly. If it is larger than the image, the coordinates will be negative. 
If you want to capture a complete face, you can set the negative coordinates to 0 if the `completeness` score meets the requirement.
 * @method integer getY() Obtain Vertical coordinate of the top-left vertex of the face frame. 
The face frame encompasses the facial features and is extended accordingly. If it is larger than the image, the coordinates will be negative. 
If you want to capture a complete face, you can set the negative coordinates to 0 if the `completeness` score meets the requirement.
 * @method void setY(integer $Y) Set Vertical coordinate of the top-left vertex of the face frame. 
The face frame encompasses the facial features and is extended accordingly. If it is larger than the image, the coordinates will be negative. 
If you want to capture a complete face, you can set the negative coordinates to 0 if the `completeness` score meets the requirement.
 * @method integer getWidth() Obtain Face frame width.
 * @method void setWidth(integer $Width) Set Face frame width.
 * @method integer getHeight() Obtain Face frame height.
 * @method void setHeight(integer $Height) Set Face frame height.
 * @method FaceAttributesInfo getFaceAttributesInfo() Obtain Face attributes, including gender, age, expression, 
beauty, glass, mask, hair, and pose (pitch, roll, yaw). Valid information will be returned only if `NeedFaceAttributes` is set to 1.
 * @method void setFaceAttributesInfo(FaceAttributesInfo $FaceAttributesInfo) Set Face attributes, including gender, age, expression, 
beauty, glass, mask, hair, and pose (pitch, roll, yaw). Valid information will be returned only if `NeedFaceAttributes` is set to 1.
 * @method FaceQualityInfo getFaceQualityInfo() Obtain Face quality information, including score, sharpness, brightness, and completeness. Valid information will be returned only if `NeedFaceDetection` is set to 1.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setFaceQualityInfo(FaceQualityInfo $FaceQualityInfo) Set Face quality information, including score, sharpness, brightness, and completeness. Valid information will be returned only if `NeedFaceDetection` is set to 1.
