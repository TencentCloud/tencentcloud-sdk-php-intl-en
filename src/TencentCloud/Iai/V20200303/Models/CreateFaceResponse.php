 * CreateFace response structure.

 * @method integer getSucFaceNum() Obtain Number of successfully added faces
 * @method void setSucFaceNum(integer $SucFaceNum) Set Number of successfully added faces
 * @method array getSucFaceIds() Obtain List of IDs of successfully added faces
 * @method void setSucFaceIds(array $SucFaceIds) Set List of IDs of successfully added faces
 * @method array getRetCode() Obtain Adding result for each face image. -1101: no face detected; -1102: image decoding failed; 
-1601: the image quality control requirement is not met; -1604: the face similarity is not above `FaceMatchThreshold`. 
Other non-zero values: algorithm service exception. 
The order of `RetCode` values is the same as the order of `Images` or `Urls` in the input parameter.
 * @method void setRetCode(array $RetCode) Set Adding result for each face image. -1101: no face detected; -1102: image decoding failed; 
-1601: the image quality control requirement is not met; -1604: the face similarity is not above `FaceMatchThreshold`.

 * @method array getSucIndexes() Obtain Indexes of successfully added faces. The order of indexes is the same as the order of `Images` or `Urls` in the input parameter. 
For example, if there are 3 URLs in `Urls`, and the second URL fails, then the value of `SucIndexes` will be [0,2].
 * @method void setSucIndexes(array $SucIndexes) Set Indexes of successfully added faces. The order of indexes is the same as the order of `Images` or `Urls` in the input parameter. 
For example, if there are 3 URLs in `Urls`, and the second URL fails, then the value of `SucIndexes` will be [0,2].
 * @method array getSucFaceRects() Obtain Frame positions of successfully added faces. The order is the same as the order of `Images` or `Urls` in the input parameter.
 * @method void setSucFaceRects(array $SucFaceRects) Set Frame positions of successfully added faces. The order is the same as the order of `Images` or `Urls` in the input parameter.
 * @method string getFaceModelVersion() Obtain Algorithm model version used for face recognition.
 * @method void setFaceModelVersion(string $FaceModelVersion) Set Algorithm model version used for face recognition.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, which is returned for each request. RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, which is returned for each request. RequestId is required for locating a problem.
