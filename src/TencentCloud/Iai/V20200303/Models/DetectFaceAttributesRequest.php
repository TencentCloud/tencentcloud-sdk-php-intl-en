/**
 * DetectFaceAttributes request structure.
 *
 * @method integer getMaxFaceNum() Obtain Maximum number of processable faces. 
Default value: 1 (i.e., detecting only the face with the largest size in the image). Maximum value: 120. 
This parameter is used to control the number of faces in the image to be detected. The smaller the value, the faster the processing.
 * @method void setMaxFaceNum(integer $MaxFaceNum) Set Maximum number of processable faces. 
Default value: 1 (i.e., detecting only the face with the largest size in the image). Maximum value: 120. 
This parameter is used to control the number of faces in the image to be detected. The smaller the value, the faster the processing.
 * @method string getImage() Obtain Base64-encoded image data, which cannot exceed 5 MB.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats. 
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method void setImage(string $Image) Set Base64-encoded image data, which cannot exceed 5 MB.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats. 
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method string getUrl() Obtain Image URL. 
The image cannot exceed 5 MB in size after being Base64-encoded. 
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used. 
We recommend storing the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. 
The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low. 
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method void setUrl(string $Url) Set Image URL. 
The image cannot exceed 5 MB in size after being Base64-encoded. 
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used. 
We recommend storing the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. 
The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low. 
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method string getFaceAttributesType() Obtain Whether to return attributes such as age, gender, and emotion. 
Valid values (case-insensitive): None, Age, Beauty, Emotion, Eye, Eyebrow, Gender, Hair, Hat, Headpose, Mask, Mouth, Moustache, Nose, Shape, Skin, Smile. 
  
`None` indicates that no attributes need to be returned, which is the default value; that is, if the `FaceAttributesType` attribute is empty, the values of all attributes will be `0`.
You need to combine the attributes into a string and separate them by comma. The sequence of the attributes is not limited. 
For more information on the attributes, see the output parameters as described below. 
The face attribute information of up to 5 largest faces in the image will be returned, and `AttributesInfo` of the 6th and rest faces is meaningless.
 * @method void setFaceAttributesType(string $FaceAttributesType) Set Whether to return attributes such as age, gender, and emotion. 
Valid values (case-insensitive): None, Age, Beauty, Emotion, Eye, Eyebrow, Gender, Hair, Hat, Headpose, Mask, Mouth, Moustache, Nose, Shape, Skin, Smile. 
  
`None` indicates that no attributes need to be returned, which is the default value; that is, if the `FaceAttributesType` attribute is empty, the values of all attributes will be `0`.

The face attribute information of up to 5 largest faces in the image will be returned, and `AttributesInfo` of the 6th and rest faces is meaningless.
 * @method integer getNeedRotateDetection() Obtain Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image is not rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
 * @method void setNeedRotateDetection(integer $NeedRotateDetection) Set Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image is not rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
 * @method string getFaceModelVersion() Obtain Algorithm model version used by the Face Recognition service. You can enter only `3.0` for this API.
 * @method void setFaceModelVersion(string $FaceModelVersion) Set Algorithm model version used by the Face Recognition service. You can enter only `3.0` for this API.
