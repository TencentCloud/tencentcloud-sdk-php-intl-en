/**
 * VerifyFace response structure.
 *
 * @method float getScore() Obtain Similarity between given face image and `PersonId`. If there are multiple faces under the `PersonId`, the score of the highest similarity will be returned.

The returned similarity score varies by algorithm version.
If you need to verify whether the faces in the two images are the same person, then the 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001% FARs on v3.0 correspond to scores of 40, 50, and 60, respectively. Generally, if the score is above 50, it can be judged that they are the same person.
The 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001% FARs on v2.0 correspond to scores of 70, 80, and 90, respectively. Generally, if the score is above 80, it can be judged that they are the same person.
 * @method void setScore(float $Score) Set Similarity between given face image and `PersonId`. If there are multiple faces under the `PersonId`, the score of the highest similarity will be returned.

The returned similarity score varies by algorithm version.

 * @method boolean getIsMatch() Obtain Whether the person is the one in the image. The fixed threshold score is 60. If you want to adjust the threshold more flexibly, you can take the returned `Score` parameter value for judgment.
 * @method void setIsMatch(boolean $IsMatch) Set Whether the person is the one in the image. The fixed threshold score is 60. If you want to adjust the threshold more flexibly, you can take the returned `Score` parameter value for judgment.
 * @method string getFaceModelVersion() Obtain Algorithm model version used for face recognition in the group where the `Person` is, which is set when the group is created.
 * @method void setFaceModelVersion(string $FaceModelVersion) Set Algorithm model version used for face recognition in the group where the `Person` is, which is set when the group is created.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, which is returned for each request. RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, which is returned for each request. RequestId is required for locating a problem.
