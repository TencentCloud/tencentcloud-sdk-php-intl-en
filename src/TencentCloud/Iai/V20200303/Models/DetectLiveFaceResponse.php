 * DetectLiveFace response structure.

 * @method float getScore() Obtain Liveness score. Value range: [0,100]. The score is generally between 80 and 100, but 0 is also a common value. As a recommendation, when the score is greater than 87, it can be judged that the person in the image is alive. You can adjust the threshold according to your specific scenario.
This field is meaningful only if `FaceModelVersion` is 2.0.
 * @method void setScore(float $Score) Set Liveness score. Value range: [0,100]. The score is generally between 80 and 100, but 0 is also a common value. As a recommendation, when the score is greater than 87, it can be judged that the person in the image is alive. You can adjust the threshold according to your specific scenario.
This field is meaningful only if `FaceModelVersion` is 2.0.
 * @method string getFaceModelVersion() Obtain Algorithm model version used for face recognition.
 * @method void setFaceModelVersion(string $FaceModelVersion) Set Algorithm model version used for face recognition.
 * @method boolean getIsLiveness() Obtain Whether liveness detection is passed.
This field is meaningful only if `FaceModelVersion` is 3.0.
 * @method void setIsLiveness(boolean $IsLiveness) Set Whether liveness detection is passed.
This field is meaningful only if `FaceModelVersion` is 3.0.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, which is returned for each request. RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, which is returned for each request. RequestId is required for locating a problem.
