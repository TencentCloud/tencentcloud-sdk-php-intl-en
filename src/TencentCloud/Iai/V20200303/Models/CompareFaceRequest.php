 * @method string getFaceModelVersion() Obtain Algorithm model version used by the Face Recognition service.

Currently, `2.0` and `3.0` are supported.

This parameter is `3.0` by default starting from April 2, 2020. If it is left empty for accounts that used this API, `2.0` will be used by default.

The parameter can be set only to `3.0` for accounts that purchase the service after November 26, 2020.

Different algorithm model versions correspond to different face recognition algorithms. The 3.0 version has a better overall effect than the legacy version and is recommended.
 * @method void setFaceModelVersion(string $FaceModelVersion) Set Algorithm model version used by the Face Recognition service.

Currently, `2.0` and `3.0` are supported.

This parameter is `3.0` by default starting from April 2, 2020. If it is left empty for accounts that used this API, `2.0` will be used by default.

The parameter can be set only to `3.0` for accounts that purchase the service after November 26, 2020.

Different algorithm model versions correspond to different face recognition algorithms. The 3.0 version has a better overall effect than the legacy version and is recommended.
 * @method integer getQualityControl() Obtain Image quality control. 
0: no control. 
1: low quality requirement. The image has one or more of the following problems: extreme blurriness, covered eyes, covered nose, and covered mouth. 
2: average quality requirement. The image has at least three of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, blurriness or average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
3: high-quality requirement. The image has one to two of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
4: very high-quality requirement. The image is optimal in all dimensions or only has a slight problem in one dimension. 
Default value: 0. 
If the image quality does not meet the requirement, the returned result will prompt that the detected image quality is unsatisfactory.
 * @method void setQualityControl(integer $QualityControl) Set Image quality control. 
0: no control. 
1: low quality requirement. The image has one or more of the following problems: extreme blurriness, covered eyes, covered nose, and covered mouth. 
2: average quality requirement. The image has at least three of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, blurriness or average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
3: high-quality requirement. The image has one to two of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
4: very high-quality requirement. The image is optimal in all dimensions or only has a slight problem in one dimension. 
Default value: 0. 
If the image quality does not meet the requirement, the returned result will prompt that the detected image quality is unsatisfactory.
 * @method integer getNeedRotateDetection() Obtain Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image will not be rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
 * @method void setNeedRotateDetection(integer $NeedRotateDetection) Set Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image will not be rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
