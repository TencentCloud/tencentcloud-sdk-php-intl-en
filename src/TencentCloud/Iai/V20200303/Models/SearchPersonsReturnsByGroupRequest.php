/**
 * SearchPersonsReturnsByGroup request structure.
 *
 * @method array getGroupIds() Obtain List of groups to be searched in (up to 60). The array element value is the `GroupId` in the `CreateGroup` API.
 * @method void setGroupIds(array $GroupIds) Set List of groups to be searched in (up to 60). The array element value is the `GroupId` in the `CreateGroup` API.
 * @method string getImage() Obtain Base64-encoded image data, which cannot exceed 5 MB.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method void setImage(string $Image) Set Base64-encoded image data, which cannot exceed 5 MB.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method string getUrl() Obtain Image URL. The image cannot exceed 5 MB in size after being Base64-encoded.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used.
We recommend storing the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability.
The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method void setUrl(string $Url) Set Image URL. The image cannot exceed 5 MB in size after being Base64-encoded.
The long side cannot exceed 4,000 px for images in JPG format or 2,000 px for images in other formats.
Either `Url` or `Image` must be provided; if both are provided, only `Url` will be used.

The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.
 * @method integer getMaxFaceNum() Obtain Maximum number of recognizable faces. Default value: 1 (i.e., detecting only the face with the largest size in the image). Maximum value: 10.
`MaxFaceNum` is used to control the number of faces to be searched for if there are multiple faces in the input image to be recognized.
For example, if the input image in `Image` or `Url` contains multiple faces and `MaxFaceNum` is 5, top 5 faces with the largest size in the image will be recognized.
 * @method void setMaxFaceNum(integer $MaxFaceNum) Set Maximum number of recognizable faces. Default value: 1 (i.e., detecting only the face with the largest size in the image). Maximum value: 10.
`MaxFaceNum` is used to control the number of faces to be searched for if there are multiple faces in the input image to be recognized.
For example, if the input image in `Image` or `Url` contains multiple faces and `MaxFaceNum` is 5, top 5 faces with the largest size in the image will be recognized.
 * @method integer getMinFaceSize() Obtain Minimum height and width of face in px. Default value: 34. A value below 34 will affect the search accuracy. We recommend setting this parameter to 80.
 * @method void setMinFaceSize(integer $MinFaceSize) Set Minimum height and width of face in px. Default value: 34. A value below 34 will affect the search accuracy. We recommend setting this parameter to 80.
 * @method integer getMaxPersonNumPerGroup() Obtain Detected faces, which is corresponding to the maximum number of returned most matching persons. Default value: 5. Maximum value: 10.  
For example, if `MaxFaceNum` is 3, `MaxPersonNumPerGroup` is 5, and the `GroupIds` length is 3, up to 45 (3 * 5 * 3) persons will be returned.
 * @method void setMaxPersonNumPerGroup(integer $MaxPersonNumPerGroup) Set Detected faces, which is corresponding to the maximum number of returned most matching persons. Default value: 5. Maximum value: 10.  
For example, if `MaxFaceNum` is 3, `MaxPersonNumPerGroup` is 5, and the `GroupIds` length is 3, up to 45 (3 * 5 * 3) persons will be returned.
 * @method integer getQualityControl() Obtain Image quality control. 
0: no control. 
1: low quality requirement. The image has one or more of the following problems: extreme blurriness, covered eyes, covered nose, and covered mouth. 
2: average quality requirement. The image has at least three of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, blurriness or average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
3: high-quality requirement. The image has one to two of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
4: very high-quality requirement. The image is optimal in all dimensions or only has a slight problem in one dimension. 
Default value: 0. 
If the image quality does not meet the requirement, the returned result will prompt that the detected image quality is unsatisfactory.
 * @method void setQualityControl(integer $QualityControl) Set Image quality control. 
0: no control. 
1: low quality requirement. The image has one or more of the following problems: extreme blurriness, covered eyes, covered nose, and covered mouth. 
2: average quality requirement. The image has at least three of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, blurriness or average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
3: high-quality requirement. The image has one to two of the following problems: excessive brightness, excessive dimness, average blurriness, covered eyebrows, covered cheeks, and covered chin. 
4: very high-quality requirement. The image is optimal in all dimensions or only has a slight problem in one dimension. 
Default value: 0. 
If the image quality does not meet the requirement, the returned result will prompt that the detected image quality is unsatisfactory.
 * @method float getFaceMatchThreshold() Obtain In the output parameter `Score`, the result will be returned only if the result value is above the `FaceMatchThreshold` value. Default value: 0.
 * @method void setFaceMatchThreshold(float $FaceMatchThreshold) Set In the output parameter `Score`, the result will be returned only if the result value is above the `FaceMatchThreshold` value. Default value: 0.
 * @method integer getNeedPersonInfo() Obtain Whether to return person details. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. Other values will be considered as 0 by default.
 * @method void setNeedPersonInfo(integer $NeedPersonInfo) Set Whether to return person details. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. Other values will be considered as 0 by default.
 * @method integer getNeedRotateDetection() Obtain Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image will not be rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
 * @method void setNeedRotateDetection(integer $NeedRotateDetection) Set Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image will not be rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
