 * @method float getScore() Obtain The value range is [0.00, 100.00]. It is recommended that when the similarity is greater than or equal to 70, the person can be judged to be the same person, and the threshold can be adjusted according to the specific scenario (the false pass rate for a threshold of 70 is one in 1,000, and the false pass rate for a threshold of 80 is one in 10,000).
 * @method void setScore(float $Score) Set The value range is [0.00, 100.00]. It is recommended that when the similarity is greater than or equal to 70, the person can be judged to be the same person, and the threshold can be adjusted according to the specific scenario (the false pass rate for a threshold of 70 is one in 1,000, and the false pass rate for a threshold of 80 is one in 10,000).
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
