 * Face attributes, including gender, age, expression, 
beauty, glass, mask, hair, and pose (pitch, roll, yaw). Valid information will be returned only if `NeedFaceAttributes` is set to 1. The face attribute information of up to 5 largest faces in the image will be returned, and `FaceAttributesInfo` of the 6th and rest faces is meaningless.
 *
 * @method integer getGender() Obtain Gender. The gender is female for the value range [0,49] and male for the value range [50,100]. The closer the value to 0 or 100, the higher the confidence. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method void setGender(integer $Gender) Set Gender. The gender is female for the value range [0,49] and male for the value range [50,100]. The closer the value to 0 or 100, the higher the confidence. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method integer getAge() Obtain Age. Value range: [0,100]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method void setAge(integer $Age) Set Age. Value range: [0,100]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method integer getExpression() Obtain Expression. Value range: [0 (normal)–50 (smile)–100 (laugh)]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method void setExpression(integer $Expression) Set Expression. Value range: [0 (normal)–50 (smile)–100 (laugh)]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method boolean getGlass() Obtain Whether glasses are present. Valid values: true, false. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method void setGlass(boolean $Glass) Set Whether glasses are present. Valid values: true, false. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method integer getPitch() Obtain Vertical offset in degrees. Value range: [-30,30]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless. 
We recommend selecting images in the [-10,10] range for adding faces.
 * @method void setPitch(integer $Pitch) Set Vertical offset in degrees. Value range: [-30,30]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless. 
We recommend selecting images in the [-10,10] range for adding faces.
 * @method integer getYaw() Obtain Horizontal offset in degrees. Value range: [-30,30]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless. 
We recommend selecting images in the [-10,10] range for adding faces.

We recommend selecting images in the [-10,10] range for adding faces.
 * @method integer getRoll() Obtain Horizontal rotation in degrees. Value range: [-180,180]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.  
We recommend selecting images in the [-20,20] range for adding faces.
 * @method void setRoll(integer $Roll) Set Horizontal rotation in degrees. Value range: [-180,180]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.  
We recommend selecting images in the [-20,20] range for adding faces.
 * @method integer getBeauty() Obtain Beauty. Value range: [0,100]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method void setBeauty(integer $Beauty) Set Beauty. Value range: [0,100]. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
 * @method boolean getHat() Obtain Whether hat is present. Valid values: true, false. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setHat(boolean $Hat) Set Whether hat is present. Valid values: true, false. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.

Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setHair(FaceHairAttributesInfo $Hair) Set Hair information, including length, bang, and color. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method boolean getEyeOpen() Obtain Whether the eyes are open. Valid values: true, false. As long as there is more than one eye closed, `false` will be returned. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setEyeOpen(boolean $EyeOpen) Set Whether the eyes are open. Valid values: true, false. As long as there is more than one eye closed, `false` will be returned. If `NeedFaceAttributes` is not 1 or more than 5 faces are detected, this parameter will still be returned but meaningless.
