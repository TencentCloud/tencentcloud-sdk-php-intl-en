 * @method integer getInternetMaxBandwidthOut() Obtain Maximum outbound bandwidth, in Mbps. This parameter is valid only for public network shared, LCU-supported, and exclusive CLB instances and private network LCU-supported CLB instances.
- The range of the maximum outbound bandwidth for public network shared and exclusive CLB instances is 1 Mbps to 2,048 Mbps.
- The range of the maximum outbound bandwidth for public network and private network LCU-supported CLB instances is 1 Mbps to 61,440 Mbps.
(If this parameter is not specified when CreateLoadBalancer is called to create a CLB instance, the default value of 10 Mbps is used. This value can be modified.)
