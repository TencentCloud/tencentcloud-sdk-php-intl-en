/**
 * ModifySubscriptionAttribute request structure.
 *
 * @method string getTopicName() Obtain Topic name, which is unique under the same account in an individual region. It is a string of up to 64 characters, which must begin with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and dashes (`-`).
 * @method void setTopicName(string $TopicName) Set Topic name, which is unique under the same account in an individual region. It is a string of up to 64 characters, which must begin with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and dashes (`-`).
 * @method string getSubscriptionName() Obtain Subscription name, which is unique in the same topic under the same account in an individual region. It is a string of up to 64 characters, which must begin with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and dashes (`-`).
 * @method void setSubscriptionName(string $SubscriptionName) Set Subscription name, which is unique in the same topic under the same account in an individual region. It is a string of up to 64 characters, which must begin with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and dashes (`-`).
 * @method string getNotifyStrategy() Obtain CMQ push server retry policy in case an error occurs while pushing a message to `Endpoint`. Valid values:
1. BACKOFF_RETRY: backoff retry, which is to retry at a fixed interval, discard the message after a certain number of retries, and continue to push the next message.
2. EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY: exponential decay retry, which is to retry at an exponentially increasing interval, such as 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, and so on. As a message can be retained in a topic for one day, failed messages will be discarded at most after one day of retry. Default value: EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY.
 * @method void setNotifyStrategy(string $NotifyStrategy) Set CMQ push server retry policy in case an error occurs while pushing a message to `Endpoint`. Valid values:
1. BACKOFF_RETRY: backoff retry, which is to retry at a fixed interval, discard the message after a certain number of retries, and continue to push the next message.
2. EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY: exponential decay retry, which is to retry at an exponentially increasing interval, such as 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, and so on. As a message can be retained in a topic for one day, failed messages will be discarded at most after one day of retry. Default value: EXPONENTIAL_DECAY_RETRY.
 * @method string getNotifyContentFormat() Obtain Push content format. Valid values: 1. JSON, 2. SIMPLIFIED, i.e., the raw format. If `Protocol` is `queue`, this value must be `SIMPLIFIED`. If `Protocol` is `HTTP`, both options are acceptable, and the default value is `JSON`.
 * @method void setNotifyContentFormat(string $NotifyContentFormat) Set Push content format. Valid values: 1. JSON, 2. SIMPLIFIED, i.e., the raw format. If `Protocol` is `queue`, this value must be `SIMPLIFIED`. If `Protocol` is `HTTP`, both options are acceptable, and the default value is `JSON`.
 * @method array getFilterTags() Obtain Message body tag (used for message filtering). The number of tags cannot exceed 5, and each tag can contain up to 16 characters. It is used in conjunction with the `MsgTag` parameter of `(Batch)PublishMessage`. Rules: 1. If `FilterTag` is not set, no matter whether `MsgTag` is set, the subscription will receive all messages published to the topic; 2. If the `FilterTag` array has a value, only when at least one of the values in the array also exists in the `MsgTag` array (i.e., `FilterTag` and `MsgTag` have an intersection) can the subscription receive messages published to the topic; 3. If the `FilterTag` array has a value, but `MsgTag` is not set, then no message published to the topic will be received, which can be considered as a special case of rule 2 as `FilterTag` and `MsgTag` do not intersect in this case. The overall design idea of rules is based on the intention of the subscriber.
 * @method void setFilterTags(array $FilterTags) Set Message body tag (used for message filtering). The number of tags cannot exceed 5, and each tag can contain up to 16 characters. It is used in conjunction with the `MsgTag` parameter of `(Batch)PublishMessage`. Rules: 1. If `FilterTag` is not set, no matter whether `MsgTag` is set, the subscription will receive all messages published to the topic; 2.

The overall design idea of rules is based on the intention of the subscriber.
 * @method array getBindingKey() Obtain The number of `BindingKey` cannot exceed 5, and the length of each `BindingKey` cannot exceed 64 bytes. This field indicates the filtering policy for subscribing to and receiving messages. Each `BindingKey` can contain up to 15 `.`, i.e., up to 16 phrases.
 * @method void setBindingKey(array $BindingKey) Set The number of `BindingKey` cannot exceed 5, and the length of each `BindingKey` cannot exceed 64 bytes. This field indicates the filtering policy for subscribing to and receiving messages. Each `BindingKey` can contain up to 15 `.`, i.e., up to 16 phrases.
