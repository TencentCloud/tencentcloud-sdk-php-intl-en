 * @method array getIoRatioPerSec() Obtain Time percentage of IO operations per second
 * @method void setIoRatioPerSec(array $IoRatioPerSec) Set Time percentage of IO operations per second
 * @method array getIoWaitTime() Obtain Average wait time of device I/O operations * 100 in milliseconds. For example, if the value is 201, the average wait time of I/O operations is 201/100 = 2.1 milliseconds.

 * @method array getRead() Obtain Average number of read operations completed by the disk per second * 100. For example, if the value is 2,002, the average number of read operations completed by the disk per second is 2,002/100=20.2.
