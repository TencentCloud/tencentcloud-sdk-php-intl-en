/**
 * Search filter for audit log
 *
 * @method string getType() Obtain Filter condition. The search conditions are supported as follows:

Include/Exclude, and Include/Exclude (segment dimension) can be used to search for:
`sql` - SQL details.

`Equal to`, `Not equal to`, `Include`, and `Exclude` can be used to search for:
`host` - Client IP,
`user` - Username,
`DBName` - Database name.

`Equal to` and `Not equal to` can be used to search for:
`sqlType` - SQL type,
`errCode` - Error code,
`threadId` - Thread ID.

Range search is supported for:
`execTime`- Execution time (μs),
`lockWaitTime` - Lock wait time (μs),
`ioWaitTime` - IO wait time (μs),
`trxLivingTime` - Transaction duration (μs),
`cpuTime` - CPU time (μs),
`checkRows` - Number of scanned rows,
`affectRows` - Number of affected rows,
`sentRows` - Number of returned rows.
 * @method void setType(string $Type) Set Filter condition. The search conditions are supported as follows:

Include/Exclude, and Include/Exclude (segment dimension) can be used to search for:
`sql` - SQL details.

`Equal to`, `Not equal to`, `Include`, and `Exclude` can be used to search for:

`DBName` - Database name.

`Equal to` and `Not equal to` can be used to search for:
`sqlType` - SQL type,
`errCode` - Error code,
`threadId` - Thread ID.

Range search is supported for:
`execTime`- Execution time (μs),
`lockWaitTime` - Lock wait time (μs),
`ioWaitTime` - IO wait time (μs),
`trxLivingTime` - Transaction duration (μs),
`cpuTime` - CPU time (μs),
`checkRows` - Number of scanned rows,
`affectRows` - Number of affected rows,
`sentRows` - Number of returned rows.
 * @method string getCompare() Obtain Filter. Valid values:
`WINC` - Include (segment dimension)
`WEXC` - Exclude (segment dimension)
`INC` - Include,
`EXC` - Exclude,
`EQS` - Equal to,
`NEQ` - Not equal to.
`RA` - Range
 * @method void setCompare(string $Compare) Set Filter. Valid values:
`WINC` - Include (segment dimension)
`WEXC` - Exclude (segment dimension)
`INC` - Include,
`EXC` - Exclude,
`EQS` - Equal to,
`NEQ` - Not equal to.
`RA` - Range
 * @method array getValue() Obtain The filter value. In a reverse query, multiple values are in an "AND" relationship; while in a forward query, multiple values are in an "OR" relationship.
 * @method void setValue(array $Value) Set The filter value. In a reverse query, multiple values are in an "AND" relationship; while in a forward query, multiple values are in an "OR" relationship.
