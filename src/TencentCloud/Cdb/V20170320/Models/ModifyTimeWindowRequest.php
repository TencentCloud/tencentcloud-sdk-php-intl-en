 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Instance ID in the format of cdb-c1nl9rpv or cdbro-c1nl9rpv. It is the same as the instance ID displayed on the TencentDB Console page.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Instance ID in the format of cdb-c1nl9rpv or cdbro-c1nl9rpv. It is the same as the instance ID displayed on the TencentDB Console page.
 * @method array getTimeRanges() Obtain Time period available for maintenance after modification in the format of 10:00-12:00. Each period lasts from half an hour to three hours, with the start time and end time aligned by half-hour. Up to two time periods can be set. Start and end time range: [00:00, 24:00].
 * @method void setTimeRanges(array $TimeRanges) Set Time period available for maintenance after modification in the format of 10:00-12:00. Each period lasts from half an hour to three hours, with the start time and end time aligned by half-hour. Up to two time periods can be set. Start and end time range: [00:00, 24:00].
 * @method array getWeekdays() Obtain Specifies for which day to modify the time period. Value range: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. If it is not specified or is left blank, the time period will be modified for every day by default.
 * @method void setWeekdays(array $Weekdays) Set Specifies for which day to modify the time period. Value range: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. If it is not specified or is left blank, the time period will be modified for every day by default.
 * @method integer getMaxDelayTime() Obtain Data delay threshold. It takes effect only for source instance and disaster recovery instance. Default value: 10.
