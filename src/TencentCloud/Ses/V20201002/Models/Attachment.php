 * @method string getFileName() Obtain Attachment name, which cannot exceed 255 characters. Some attachment types are not supported. For details, see [Attachment Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1288/51951?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method void setFileName(string $FileName) Set Attachment name, which cannot exceed 255 characters. Some attachment types are not supported. For details, see [Attachment Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1288/51951?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method string getContent() Obtain Base64-encoded attachment content. You can send attachments of up to 4 MB in the total size. Note: The TencentCloud API supports a request packet of up to 8 MB in size, and the size of the attachment content will increase by 1.5 times after Base64 encoding. Therefore, you need to keep the total size of all attachments below 4 MB. If the entire request exceeds 8 MB, the API will return an error.
