 * @method string getStartTime() Obtain Query start time, such as 2018-09-04 10:40:10; the returned result is later than or equal to the specified time.
According to the specified time granularity, forward rounding is applied; for example, if the query start time is 2018-09-04 10:40:10 and the query time granularity is 5 minutes, the time for the first returned entry will be 2018-09-04 10:40:00.
 * @method void setStartTime(string $StartTime) Set Query start time, such as 2018-09-04 10:40:10; the returned result is later than or equal to the specified time.
According to the specified time granularity, forward rounding is applied; for example, if the query start time is 2018-09-04 10:40:10 and the query time granularity is 5 minutes, the time for the first returned entry will be 2018-09-04 10:40:00.
 * @method string getEndTime() Obtain Query end time, such as 2018-09-04 10:40:10; the returned result is earlier than or equal to the specified time.
According to the specified time granularity, forward rounding is applied; for example, if the query start time is 2018-09-04 10:40:10 and the query time granularity is 5 minutes, the time for the last returned entry will be 2018-09-04 10:40:00.
 * @method void setEndTime(string $EndTime) Set Query end time, such as 2018-09-04 10:40:10; the returned result is earlier than or equal to the specified time.
According to the specified time granularity, forward rounding is applied; for example, if the query start time is 2018-09-04 10:40:10 and the query time granularity is 5 minutes, the time for the last returned entry will be 2018-09-04 10:40:00.
 * @method array getDomains() Obtain Specifies the list of domain names to be queried; up to 30 domain names can be queried at a time.
 * @method void setDomains(array $Domains) Set Specifies the list of domain names to be queried; up to 30 domain names can be queried at a time.
 * @method integer getProject() Obtain Specifies the project ID to be queried, which can be viewed [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/project)
Please note that if domain names are specified, this parameter will be ignored.
 * @method void setProject(integer $Project) Set Specifies the project ID to be queried, which can be viewed [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/project)
Please note that if domain names are specified, this parameter will be ignored.
 * @method string getInterval() Obtain Sampling interval in minutes. The available options vary for different query period. See below: 
5min: 5 minutes. If the query period is within 24 hours, `5min` will be used by default.
day: 1 day. If the query period is longer than 24 hours, `day` will be used by default.
 * @method void setInterval(string $Interval) Set Sampling interval in minutes. The available options vary for different query period. See below: 
5min: 5 minutes. If the query period is within 24 hours, `5min` will be used by default.
day: 1 day. If the query period is longer than 24 hours, `day` will be used by default.
