 * DescribePayType response structure.
 *
 * @method string getPayType() Obtain Billing type
`flux`: Bill by traffic
`bandwidth`: Bill by bandwidth
`request`: Bill by the number of requests
`flux_sep`: Bill by dynamic and static traffic separately 
`bandwidth_sep`: Bill by dynamic and static bandwidth separately
If you incur any usage when switching the billing mode, the new mode will take effect the next day. If no usage is incurred, the new mode takes effect immediately.
 * @method void setPayType(string $PayType) Set Billing type
`flux`: Bill by traffic
`bandwidth`: Bill by bandwidth
`request`: Bill by the number of requests
`flux_sep`: Bill by dynamic and static traffic separately 
`bandwidth_sep`: Bill by dynamic and static bandwidth separately
If you incur any usage when switching the billing mode, the new mode will take effect the next day. If no usage is incurred, the new mode takes effect immediately.
 * @method string getBillingCycle() Obtain Billing cycle
`day`: Daily
`month`: Monthly
`hour`: Hourly
 * @method void setBillingCycle(string $BillingCycle) Set Billing cycle
`day`: Daily
`month`: Monthly
`hour`: Hourly
 * @method string getStatType() Obtain Statistic data
`monthMax`: Billed monthly based on the monthly average daily peak traffic
`day95`: Billed monthly based on the daily 95th percentile bandwidth
`month95`: Billed monthly based on the monthly 95th percentile bandwidth
`sum`: Billed daily/monthly based on the total traffic or requests
`max`: Billed daily based on the peak bandwidth
 * @method void setStatType(string $StatType) Set Statistic data
`monthMax`: Billed monthly based on the monthly average daily peak traffic
`day95`: Billed monthly based on the daily 95th percentile bandwidth
`month95`: Billed monthly based on the monthly 95th percentile bandwidth
`sum`: Billed daily/monthly based on the total traffic or requests
`max`: Billed daily based on the peak bandwidth
 * @method string getRegionType() Obtain Regionl billing
`all`: Unified billing for all regions
`multiple`: Region-specific billing
 * @method void setRegionType(string $RegionType) Set Regionl billing
`all`: Unified billing for all regions
`multiple`: Region-specific billing
 * @method string getCurrentPayType() Obtain Current billing mode
`flux`: Bill by traffic
`bandwidth`: Bill by bandwidth
`request`: Bill by the number of requests
`flux_sep`: Bill by dynamic and static traffic separately 
`bandwidth_sep`: Bill by dynamic and static bandwidth separately
 * @method void setCurrentPayType(string $CurrentPayType) Set Current billing mode
`flux`: Bill by traffic
`bandwidth`: Bill by bandwidth
`request`: Bill by the number of requests
`flux_sep`: Bill by dynamic and static traffic separately 
`bandwidth_sep`: Bill by dynamic and static bandwidth separately
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
