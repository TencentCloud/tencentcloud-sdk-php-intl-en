 * @method string getStartTime() Obtain Start time of the query, e.g., 2018-09-04 10:40:00.
The specified start time will be rounded down based on the granularity parameter `Interval`. For example, if you set the start time to 2018-09-04 10:40:00 with 1-hour granularity, the time will be rounded down to 2018-09-04 10:00:00.
The period between the start time and end time can be up to 90 days.
 * @method void setStartTime(string $StartTime) Set Start time of the query, e.g., 2018-09-04 10:40:00.
The specified start time will be rounded down based on the granularity parameter `Interval`. For example, if you set the start time to 2018-09-04 10:40:00 with 1-hour granularity, the time will be rounded down to 2018-09-04 10:00:00.
The period between the start time and end time can be up to 90 days.
 * @method string getEndTime() Obtain End time of the query, e.g. 2018-09-04 10:40:00.
The specified end time will be rounded down based on the granularity parameter `Interval`. For example, if you set the end time to 2018-09-04 10:40:00 with 1-hour granularity, the time will be rounded down to 2018-09-04 10:00:00.
