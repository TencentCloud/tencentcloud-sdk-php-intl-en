/**
 * Input parameter of SVG watermarking template
 *
 * @method string getWidth() Obtain Watermark width, which supports six formats of px, %, W%, H%, S%, and L%:
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Width` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Width` is 100 px; if `0px` is entered
 and `Height` is not `0px`, the watermark width will be proportionally scaled based on the source SVG image; if `0px` is entered for both `Width` and `Height`, the watermark width will be the width of the source SVG image;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `W%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video width; for example, `10W%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video width;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `H%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height; for example, `10H%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `S%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the short side of the video; for example, `10S%` means that `Width` is 10% of the short side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `L%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the long side of the video; for example, `10L%` means that `Width` is 10% of the long side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in %, the meaning is the same as `W%`.</li>
Default value: 10W%.
 * @method void setWidth(string $Width) Set Watermark width, which supports six formats of px, %, W%, H%, S%, and L%:
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Width` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Width` is 100 px; if `0px` is entered
 and `Height` is not `0px`, the watermark width will be proportionally scaled based on the source SVG image; if `0px` is entered for both `Width` and `Height`, the watermark width will be the width of the source SVG image;</li>

<li>If the string ends in `H%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height; for example, `10H%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `S%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the short side of the video; for example, `10S%` means that `Width` is 10% of the short side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `L%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the long side of the video; for example, `10L%` means that `Width` is 10% of the long side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in %, the meaning is the same as `W%`.</li>
Default value: 10W%.
 * @method string getHeight() Obtain Watermark height, which supports six formats of px, %, W%, H%, S%, and L%:
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Height` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Height` is 100 px; if `0px` is entered
 and `Width` is not `0px`, the watermark height will be proportionally scaled based on the source SVG image; if `0px` is entered for both `Width` and `Height`, the watermark height will be the height of the source SVG image;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `W%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video width; for example, `10W%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video width;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `H%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height; for example, `10H%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video height;</li>

<li>If the string ends in %, the meaning is the same as `H%`.</li>
Default value: 0 px.
 * @method void setHeight(string $Height) Set Watermark height, which supports six formats of px, %, W%, H%, S%, and L%:
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Height` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Height` is 100 px; if `0px` is entered
