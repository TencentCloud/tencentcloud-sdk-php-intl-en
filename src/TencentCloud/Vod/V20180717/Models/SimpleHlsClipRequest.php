 * SimpleHlsClip request structure.
 *
 * @method string getUrl() Obtain URL of the HLS video in VOD that needs to be clipped.
 * @method void setUrl(string $Url) Set URL of the HLS video in VOD that needs to be clipped.
 * @method integer getSubAppId() Obtain <b>The VOD [application](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14574) ID. For customers who activate VOD service from December 25, 2023, if they want to access resources in a VOD application (whether it's the default application or a newly created one), they must fill in this field with the application ID.</b>
 * @method void setSubAppId(integer $SubAppId) Set <b>The VOD [application](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14574) ID. For customers who activate VOD service from December 25, 2023, if they want to access resources in a VOD application (whether it's the default application or a newly created one), they must fill in this field with the application ID.</b>
 * @method float getStartTimeOffset() Obtain Start offset time of clipping in seconds. Default value: 0, which means to clip from the beginning of the video. A negative number indicates how many seconds from the end of the video clipping will start at. For example, -10 means that clipping will start at the 10th second from the end.
 * @method void setStartTimeOffset(float $StartTimeOffset) Set Start offset time of clipping in seconds. Default value: 0, which means to clip from the beginning of the video. A negative number indicates how many seconds from the end of the video clipping will start at. For example, -10 means that clipping will start at the 10th second from the end.
 * @method float getEndTimeOffset() Obtain End offset time of clipping in seconds. Default value: 0, which means to clip till the end of the video. A negative number indicates how many seconds from the end of the video clipping will end. For example, -10 means that clipping will end at the 10th second from the end.
 * @method void setEndTimeOffset(float $EndTimeOffset) Set End offset time of clipping in seconds. Default value: 0, which means to clip till the end of the video. A negative number indicates how many seconds from the end of the video clipping will end. For example, -10 means that clipping will end at the 10th second from the end.
 * @method integer getIsPersistence() Obtain Whether to store the video clip persistently. 0: no (default), 1: yes.
 * @method void setIsPersistence(integer $IsPersistence) Set Whether to store the video clip persistently. 0: no (default), 1: yes.
 * @method string getExpireTime() Obtain The expiration time of the video clip that is to be saved, in [ISO date format](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/11732?from_cn_redirect=1#I). `9999-12-31T23:59:59Z` is the default value, which means the video clip will never expire. After expiration, the media file and its related resources (such as transcoding results and image sprites) will be permanently deleted. This parameter is valid only if `IsPersistence` is 1.
