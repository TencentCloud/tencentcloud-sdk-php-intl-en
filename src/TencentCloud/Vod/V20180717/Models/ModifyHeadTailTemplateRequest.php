/**
 * ModifyHeadTailTemplate request structure.
 *
 * @method integer getDefinition() Obtain HeadTail template ID.
 * @method void setDefinition(integer $Definition) Set HeadTail template ID.
 * @method integer getSubAppId() Obtain <b>The VOD [application](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14574) ID. For customers who activate VOD service from December 25, 2023, if they want to access resources in a VOD application (whether it's the default application or a newly created one), they must fill in this field with the application ID.</b>
 * @method void setSubAppId(integer $SubAppId) Set <b>The VOD [application](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14574) ID. For customers who activate VOD service from December 25, 2023, if they want to access resources in a VOD application (whether it's the default application or a newly created one), they must fill in this field with the application ID.</b>
 * @method string getName() Obtain Template name, length limit is 64 characters. Not passing means not modifying.
 * @method void setName(string $Name) Set Template name, length limit is 64 characters. Not passing means not modifying.
 * @method string getComment() Obtain Template description, limited to 256 characters. Passing nothing means no modification, passing empty means clearing it.
 * @method void setComment(string $Comment) Set Template description, limited to 256 characters. Passing nothing means no modification, passing empty means clearing it.
 * @method array getHeadCandidateSet() Obtain Title candidate list, fill in the FileId of the video. When transcoding, the title closest to the aspect ratio of the feature film will be automatically selected (when the aspect ratio is the same, the front candidate will take precedence). Supports up to 5 candidate titles. Not passing it means no modification, passing an empty array means clearing it.
 * @method void setHeadCandidateSet(array $HeadCandidateSet) Set Title candidate list, fill in the FileId of the video. When transcoding, the title closest to the aspect ratio of the feature film will be automatically selected (when the aspect ratio is the same, the front candidate will take precedence). Supports up to 5 candidate titles. Not passing it means no modification, passing an empty array means clearing it.
 * @method array getTailCandidateSet() Obtain Ending candidate list, fill in the FileId of the video. When transcoding, the ending with the aspect ratio closest to the feature film will be automatically selected (when the aspect ratio is the same, the front candidate will take precedence). Supports up to 5 candidate titles. Not passing it means no modification, passing an empty array means clearing it.
 * @method void setTailCandidateSet(array $TailCandidateSet) Set Ending candidate list, fill in the FileId of the video. When transcoding, the ending with the aspect ratio closest to the feature film will be automatically selected (when the aspect ratio is the same, the front candidate will take precedence). Supports up to 5 candidate titles. Not passing it means no modification, passing an empty array means clearing it.
 * @method string getFillType() Obtain Padding method. When the video stream configuration width and height parameters are inconsistent with the aspect ratio of the original video, the transcoding processing method is "padding". Optional filling method:
<li> stretch: stretch, stretch each frame to fill the entire screen, which may cause the transcoded video to be "squashed" or "stretched";</li> 
<li> gauss: Gaussian blur, keep the video aspect ratio unchanged, use Gaussian blur for the remaining edges; </li>
<li> white: leave blank, keep the video aspect ratio unchanged, use the remaining edges for the edge Use white filling; </li>
<li> black: Leave black, keep the video aspect ratio unchanged, and fill the remaining edges with black. </li>
The default value is not to be modified.
 * @method void setFillType(string $FillType) Set Padding method. When the video stream configuration width and height parameters are inconsistent with the aspect ratio of the original video, the transcoding processing method is "padding". Optional filling method:
<li> stretch: stretch, stretch each frame to fill the entire screen, which may cause the transcoded video to be "squashed" or "stretched";</li> 
<li> gauss: Gaussian blur, keep the video aspect ratio unchanged, use Gaussian blur for the remaining edges; </li>
<li> white: leave blank, keep the video aspect ratio unchanged, use the remaining edges for the edge Use white filling; </li>
