 * @method array getExtTimeOffsetSet() Obtain The list of screenshot time points. “s” and “%” formats are supported:
<li>When a time point string ends with “s”, its unit is second. For example, “3.5s” means the 3.5th second of the video.</li>
<li>When a time point string ends with “%”, it represents the percentage of the video’s duration. For example, “10%” means that the time point is at the 10% of the video’s entire duration.</li>

<li>When a time point string ends with “s”, its unit is second. For example, “3.5s” means the 3.5th second of the video.</li>
<li>When a time point string ends with “%”, it represents the percentage of the video’s duration. For example, “10%” means that the time point is at the 10% of the video’s entire duration.</li>
 * @method array getTimeOffsetSet() Obtain List of time points for screencapturing in <font color=red>milliseconds</font>.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setTimeOffsetSet(array $TimeOffsetSet) Set List of time points for screencapturing in <font color=red>milliseconds</font>.
Note: this field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
