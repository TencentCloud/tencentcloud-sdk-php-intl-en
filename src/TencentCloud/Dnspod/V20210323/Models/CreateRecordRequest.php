 * CreateRecord request structure.
 *
 * @method string getDomain() Obtain Domain
 * @method void setDomain(string $Domain) Set Domain
 * @method string getRecordType() Obtain Record type, which is obtained through the record type API. The value contains uppercase letters, such as `A`.
 * @method void setRecordType(string $RecordType) Set Record type, which is obtained through the record type API. The value contains uppercase letters, such as `A`.
 * @method string getRecordLine() Obtain Record split zone, which is obtained through the record split zone API.
 * @method void setRecordLine(string $RecordLine) Set Record split zone, which is obtained through the record split zone API.
 * @method string getValue() Obtain Record value, such as `IP : 200.200.200.200`, `CNAME : cname.dnspod.com`, and `MX : mail.dnspod.com`.
 * @method void setValue(string $Value) Set Record value, such as `IP : 200.200.200.200`, `CNAME : cname.dnspod.com`, and `MX : mail.dnspod.com`.
 * @method integer getDomainId() Obtain Domain ID. The `DomainId` parameter has a higher priority than `Domain`. If `DomainId` is passed in, `Domain` will be ignored.
 * @method void setDomainId(integer $DomainId) Set Domain ID. The `DomainId` parameter has a higher priority than `Domain`. If `DomainId` is passed in, `Domain` will be ignored.
 * @method string getSubDomain() Obtain Host record such as `www`. If it is not passed in, it will be `@` by default.
 * @method void setSubDomain(string $SubDomain) Set Host record such as `www`. If it is not passed in, it will be `@` by default.
 * @method string getRecordLineId() Obtain Split zone ID, which is obtained through the record split zone API. The value is a string such as `10=1`. The `RecordLineId` parameter has a higher priority than `RecordLine`. If both of them are passed in, `RecordLineId` will be used first.
 * @method void setRecordLineId(string $RecordLineId) Set Split zone ID, which is obtained through the record split zone API. The value is a string such as `10=1`. The `RecordLineId` parameter has a higher priority than `RecordLine`. If both of them are passed in, `RecordLineId` will be used first.
 * @method integer getMX() Obtain MX priority, which is required for an MX record and will take effect if the record type is MX. Value range: 1–20.
 * @method void setMX(integer $MX) Set MX priority, which is required for an MX record and will take effect if the record type is MX. Value range: 1–20.
 * @method integer getTTL() Obtain TTL. Value range: 1–604800. The minimum value varies by domain level.
 * @method void setTTL(integer $TTL) Set TTL. Value range: 1–604800. The minimum value varies by domain level.
 * @method integer getWeight() Obtain Weight information, which is an integer between 0 and 100. It is supported only for enterprise VIP domains. `0` indicates not to pass in this parameter, i.e., not to set the weight.
 * @method void setWeight(integer $Weight) Set Weight information, which is an integer between 0 and 100. It is supported only for enterprise VIP domains. `0` indicates not to pass in this parameter, i.e., not to set the weight.
 * @method string getStatus() Obtain Initial status of the record. Valid values: ENABLE, DISABLE. Default value: ENABLE. If `DISABLE` is passed in, the DNS record won't take effect, and the limit on round-robin DNS won't be verified.
 * @method void setStatus(string $Status) Set Initial status of the record. Valid values: ENABLE, DISABLE. Default value: ENABLE. If `DISABLE` is passed in, the DNS record won't take effect, and the limit on round-robin DNS won't be verified.
