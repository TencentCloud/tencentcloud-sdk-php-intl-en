Note:
app_id: user ID.

service_id: service ID.
http_host: domain name.
api_id: API ID.
uri: request path.
scheme: HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
rsp_st: request response status code.
ups_st: backend business server response status code (if the request is passed through to the backend, this variable will not be empty. If the request is blocked in API Gateway, this variable will be displayed as `-`).
cip: client IP.
uip: backend business service (upstream) IP.
vip: VIP requested to be accessed.
rsp_len: response length.
req_len: request length.
req_t: total request response time.
ups_rsp_t: total backend response time (time between connection establishment by API Gateway and backend response receipt).
ups_conn_t: time when the backend business server is successfully connected to.
ups_head_t: time when the backend response header arrives.
err_msg: error message.
tcp_rtt: client TCP connection information. RTT (Round Trip Time) consists of three parts: link propagation delay, end system processing delay, and queuing delay in router cache.
req_id: request ID.
 * @method void setLogSet(array $LogSet) Set The returned result contains any number of logs, which are in the following format:

req_id: request ID.
 * @method integer getTotalCount() Obtain Number of logs returned for one search (`TotalCount <= Limit`)
 * @method void setTotalCount(integer $TotalCount) Set Number of logs returned for one search (`TotalCount <= Limit`)
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
