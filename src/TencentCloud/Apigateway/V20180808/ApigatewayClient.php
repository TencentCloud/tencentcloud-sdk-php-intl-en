 * @method Models\AttachPluginResponse AttachPlugin(Models\AttachPluginRequest $req) This API is used to bind a plugin to an API.
 * @method Models\BindApiAppResponse BindApiApp(Models\BindApiAppRequest $req) This API is used to bind an application to an API.
 * @method Models\BindEnvironmentResponse BindEnvironment(Models\BindEnvironmentRequest $req) This API is used to bind a usage plan to a service or API.
After you publish a service to an environment, if the API requires authentication and can be called only when it is bound to a usage plan, you can use this API to bind a usage plan to the specified environment.
Currently, a usage plan can be bound to an API; however, under the same service, usage plans bound to a service and usage plans bound to an API cannot coexist. Therefore, in an environment to which a service-level usage plan has already been bound, please use the `DemoteServiceUsagePlan` API to degrade it.
