 * Description of synced database objects
 *
 * @method string getMode() Obtain Sync object type. Valid value: `Partial` (Partial objects). Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setMode(string $Mode) Set Sync object type. Valid value: `Partial` (Partial objects). Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method array getDatabases() Obtain Sync object, which is required if `Mode` is `Partial`.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setDatabases(array $Databases) Set Sync object, which is required if `Mode` is `Partial`.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method array getAdvancedObjects() Obtain Advanced object types, such as function and procedure. Note: If you want to migrate and synchronize advanced objects, the corresponding advanced object type should be included in this configuration. When advanced objects need to be synchronized, the initialization type must include the structure initialization type, that is, the Options.InitType value of the task is Structure or Full.Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.

 * @method OnlineDDL getOnlineDDL() Obtain A redundant field that specifies the online DDL type
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setOnlineDDL(OnlineDDL $OnlineDDL) Set A redundant field that specifies the online DDL type
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
