Instances that are automatically created through AS will be terminated, while those manually added to the scaling group will be removed and retained.
* If the number of remaining `IN_SERVICE` instances in the scaling group is less than the minimum capacity, this API will return an error.
* However, if the scaling group is in `DISABLED` status, the removal will not verify the relationship between the number of `IN_SERVICE` instances and the minimum capacity.
* This removal will unassociate the CVM from the CLB instance that has been configured for the scaling group.
 * @method Models\ResumeInstanceRefreshResponse ResumeInstanceRefresh(Models\ResumeInstanceRefreshRequest $req) This API is used to resume the paused instance refresh activity, allowing it to retry failed instances in the current batch or proceed with refreshing subsequent batches. Note that calling this API is ineffective when the activity is not in a paused status.

- When the MaxSurge parameter is used, the activity may be paused due to scale-out or scale-in failures. This API can also be used to retry scaling operations.
 * @method Models\RollbackInstanceRefreshResponse RollbackInstanceRefresh(Models\RollbackInstanceRefreshRequest $req) This API is used to generate a new instance refresh activity, which also supports batch refreshing and operations such as pausing, resuming, and canceling. This API returns RefreshActivityId for the rollback activity.
* The instances pending refresh in the original activity are updated to canceled status. Nonexistent instances are disregarded, while instances in all other statuses proceed to enter the rollback process.
* The instances that are being refreshed in the original activity will not be immediately terminated. Instead, the rollback activity will be executed after their refresh complete.
* Rollback is supported for activities that are in the paused status or those succeeded in refreshing last time. It is not supported for activities in other statuses.
* When the original refresh activity involves reinstalling instances, for the ImageId parameter, it will automatically recover to the image ID before the rollback; for parameters such as UserData, EnhancedService, LoginSettings, and HostName, they will still be read from the launch configuration, requiring users to manually modify the launch configuration before initiating the rollback.
* The rollback activity does not support the MaxSurge parameter currently.
 * @method Models\ScaleInInstancesResponse ScaleInInstances(Models\ScaleInInstancesRequest $req) This API is used to reduce the specified number of instances from the scaling group.
* There is no on going scaling task.
* This API is valid even when the scaling group is disabled. For more details, see [DisableAutoScalingGroup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/377/20435?from_cn_redirect=1).
* You can specify the instances to remove in the scale-in activity by using `TerminationPolicies`. For more information, see [Scaling In Policies](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/377/8563?from_cn_redirect=1).
* Only the `IN_SERVICE` instances will be reduced. To reduce instances in other statues, use the [`DetachInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/377/31011?from_cn_redirect=1) or [`RemoveInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/377/31005?from_cn_redirect=1) API.
* The desired capacity will be reduced accordingly. The new desired capacity should be no less than the minimum capacity.
* If the scale-in activity failed or partially succeeded, the final desired capacity only deducts the instances that have been reduced successfully.
 * @method Models\ScaleOutInstancesResponse ScaleOutInstances(Models\ScaleOutInstancesRequest $req) This API is used to add the specified number of instances to a scaling group. It returns the scaling activity ID `ActivityId`.
* Make sure that there are no ongoing scaling tasks.
* This API is valid even when the scaling group is disabled. For more details, see [DisableAutoScalingGroup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/377/20435?from_cn_redirect=1).
* The total number of instances after this action cannot exceed the maximum capacity.
* If a scale-out action failed or partially succeeded, only the number of successfully created instances is added to the number of desired capacity.
* If the allocation policy is `SPOT_MIXED`, there may be multiple scaling activities triggered for one scaling task. In this case, the first activity ID (`ActivityId`) is returned.
 * @method Models\SetInstancesProtectionResponse SetInstancesProtection(Models\SetInstancesProtectionRequest $req) This API is used to enable scale-in protection for an instance.
When scale-in protection is enabled, the instance will not be removed in scale-in activities triggered by replacement of unhealthy instances, alarm threshold reached, change of desired quantity, etc.
 * @method Models\StartAutoScalingInstancesResponse StartAutoScalingInstances(Models\StartAutoScalingInstancesRequest $req) This API is used to start up CVM instances in a scaling group.
* After startup, the instance will be in the `IN_SERVICE` status, which will increase the desired capacity. Please note that the desired capacity cannot exceed the maximum value.
* This API supports batch operation. Up to 100 instances can be started up in each request.
 * @method Models\StartInstanceRefreshResponse StartInstanceRefresh(Models\StartInstanceRefreshRequest $req) This API is used to refresh running CVM instances in the scaling group and return the RefreshActivityId for the instance refresh activity based on parameters in the launch configuration.
* For refresh methods involving reinstallation (currently only reinstallation is supported), during reinstallation, only the ImageId, UserData, EnhancedService, HostName, and LoginSettings parameters will be fetched from the launch configuration for refreshing; other parameters of the instance will not be refreshed.
* During the instance refresh process (including paused status), the scaling group will be disabled. It is not recommended to modify the associated launch configuration during a refresh, as this may impact the refresh parameters, leading to inconsistent instance configurations.
* In rolling update mode, instance refreshes are performed in multiple batches. If there are failed refreshes within a batch, the activity will enter a failed paused status.
* Instances pending refresh that are removed or destroyed will be marked as NOT_FOUND status, but they will not block the instance refresh activity.
* Even if a running instance has parameters consistent with the latest launch configuration, it can still undergo another refresh.
 * @method Models\StopAutoScalingInstancesResponse StopAutoScalingInstances(Models\StopAutoScalingInstancesRequest $req) This API is used to shut down CVM instances in a scaling group.
* Use the `SOFT_FIRST` shutdown, which means the CVM will be forcibly shut down if the soft shutdown fails.
* Shutting down instances in the `IN_SERVICE` status will reduce the desired capacity, but the desired capacity cannot be less than the minimum value.
* To use the `STOP_CHARGING` shutdown, the instances you want to shut down must satisfy the conditions of [no charges when shut down](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/19918?from_cn_redirect=1).
* This API supports batch operation. Up to 100 instances can be shut down in each request.
 * @method Models\StopInstanceRefreshResponse StopInstanceRefresh(Models\StopInstanceRefreshRequest $req) This API is used to pause the ongoing instance refresh activity.
* In the paused status, the scaling group will also be disabled.
* The instances that are currently being updated or scaled out will not be paused, but instances pending updates will have their updates paused.
* During scale-in, all instances have already been updated and cannot be paused.
 * @method Models\UpgradeLaunchConfigurationResponse UpgradeLaunchConfiguration(Models\UpgradeLaunchConfigurationRequest $req) There is a replacement API: ModifyLaunchConfiguration. This API carries the risk of parameter overwriting, and it has currently been hidden on the official website.
This API (UpgradeLaunchConfiguration) is used to upgrade the launch configuration.
* This API is used to upgrade the launch configuration, adopting an "entirely overwrite" approach. Regardless of previous parameter settings, they will be uniformly replaced with new configurations as specified in the interface parameters. For non-mandatory fields, if not filled in, default values will be assigned.
* After upgrading and modifying the launch configuration, existing instances that have been scaled out using this configuration will not undergo any changes. Subsequently, newly added instances using this upgraded launch configuration will be scaled out according to the new configuration.
 * @method Models\UpgradeLifecycleHookResponse UpgradeLifecycleHook(Models\UpgradeLifecycleHookRequest $req) This API is used to upgrade the lifecycle hook.

* This API is used to upgrade the lifecycle hook, adopting a "comprehensive overwrite" style. Regardless of how the previous parameters were set, it uniformly uses the new configurations for API parameters. For optional fields, if they are not filled in, default values will be used.
