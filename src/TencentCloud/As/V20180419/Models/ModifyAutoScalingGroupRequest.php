<li>EQUALITY: The instances added through scale-out will be distributed across multiple AZs/subnets to ensure a relatively balanced number of instances in each AZ/subnet after scaling out.</li>

Points to consider regarding this policy:
<li>When the scaling group is based on a classic network, this policy applies to the multi-AZ; when the scaling group is based on a VPC network, this policy applies to the multi-subnet, in this case, the AZs are no longer considered. For example, if there are four subnets labeled A, B, C, and D, where A, B, and C are in AZ 1 and D is in AZ 2, the subnets A, B, C, and D are considered for sorting without regard to AZs 1 and 2.</li>
<li>This policy applies to the multi-AZ/multi-subnet and not to the InstanceTypes parameter of the launch configuration, which is selected according to the priority policy.</li>
<li>When instances are created according to the PRIORITY policy, ensure the policy for multiple models first, followed by the policy for the multi-AZ/subnet. For example, with models A and B and subnets 1, 2, and 3, attempts will be made in the order of A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, and B3. If A1 is sold out, A2 will be attempted (instead of B1).</li>
