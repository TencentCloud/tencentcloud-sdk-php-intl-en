Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setInternetChargeType(string $InternetChargeType) Set Network billing type. Valid values: <li>BANDWIDTH_PREPAID: prepaid by bandwidth;</li> <li>TRAFFIC_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR: postpaid by traffic per hour;</li> <li>BANDWIDTH_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR: postpaid by bandwidth per hour;</li> <li>BANDWIDTH_PACKAGE: bandwidth package users.</li> Default value: TRAFFIC_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method integer getInternetMaxBandwidthOut() Obtain The maximum outbound bandwidth in Mbps of the public network. The default value is 0 Mbps. The upper limit of bandwidth varies by model. For more information, see [Purchase Network Bandwidth](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/509?from_cn_redirect=1).
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setInternetMaxBandwidthOut(integer $InternetMaxBandwidthOut) Set The maximum outbound bandwidth in Mbps of the public network. The default value is 0 Mbps.
