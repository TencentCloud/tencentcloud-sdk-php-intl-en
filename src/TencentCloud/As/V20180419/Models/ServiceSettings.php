/**
 * Service settings
 *
 * @method boolean getReplaceMonitorUnhealthy() Obtain Enables unhealthy instance replacement. If this feature is enabled, AS will replace instances that are flagged as unhealthy by Cloud Monitor. If this parameter is not specified, the value will be False by default.
 * @method void setReplaceMonitorUnhealthy(boolean $ReplaceMonitorUnhealthy) Set Enables unhealthy instance replacement. If this feature is enabled, AS will replace instances that are flagged as unhealthy by Cloud Monitor. If this parameter is not specified, the value will be False by default.
 * @method string getScalingMode() Obtain Valid values: 
CLASSIC_SCALING: this is the typical scaling method, which creates and terminates instances to perform scaling operations. 
WAKE_UP_STOPPED_SCALING: this scaling method first tries to start stopped instances. If the number of instances woken up is insufficient, the system creates new instances for scale-out. For scale-in, instances are terminated as in the typical method. You can use the StopAutoScalingInstances API to stop instances in the scaling group. Scale-out operations triggered by alarms will still create new instances.
Default value: CLASSIC_SCALING
 * @method void setScalingMode(string $ScalingMode) Set Valid values: 
CLASSIC_SCALING: this is the typical scaling method, which creates and terminates instances to perform scaling operations. 
WAKE_UP_STOPPED_SCALING: this scaling method first tries to start stopped instances. If the number of instances woken up is insufficient, the system creates new instances for scale-out. For scale-in, instances are terminated as in the typical method. You can use the StopAutoScalingInstances API to stop instances in the scaling group. Scale-out operations triggered by alarms will still create new instances.
Default value: CLASSIC_SCALING
 * @method boolean getReplaceLoadBalancerUnhealthy() Obtain Enable unhealthy instance replacement. If this feature is enabled, AS will replace instances that are found unhealthy in the CLB health check. If this parameter is not specified, the default value `False` will be used.
 * @method void setReplaceLoadBalancerUnhealthy(boolean $ReplaceLoadBalancerUnhealthy) Set Enable unhealthy instance replacement. If this feature is enabled, AS will replace instances that are found unhealthy in the CLB health check. If this parameter is not specified, the default value `False` will be used.
 * @method string getReplaceMode() Obtain Replace mode of unhealthy replacement service. Valid values:
RECREATE: Rebuild an instance to replace the original unhealthy instance.
RESET: Performing a system reinstallation on unhealthy instances to keep information such as data disks, private IP addresses, and instance IDs unchanged. The instance login settings, HostName, enhanced services, and UserData will remain consistent with the current launch configuration.
Default value: RECREATE.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setReplaceMode(string $ReplaceMode) Set Replace mode of unhealthy replacement service. Valid values:
RECREATE: Rebuild an instance to replace the original unhealthy instance.
RESET: Performing a system reinstallation on unhealthy instances to keep information such as data disks, private IP addresses, and instance IDs unchanged. The instance login settings, HostName, enhanced services, and UserData will remain consistent with the current launch configuration.
Default value: RECREATE.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method boolean getAutoUpdateInstanceTags() Obtain Automatic instance tag update. The default value is false. If this feature is enabled, tags of running instances in a scaling group will be updated as well if the scaling group tags are updated. (This feature takes effect for tag creation and editing but not tag deletion.) The update does not take effect immediately due to certain latency.
 * @method void setAutoUpdateInstanceTags(boolean $AutoUpdateInstanceTags) Set Automatic instance tag update. The default value is false. If this feature is enabled, tags of running instances in a scaling group will be updated as well if the scaling group tags are updated. (This feature takes effect for tag creation and editing but not tag deletion.) The update does not take effect immediately due to certain latency.
