/**
 * Specifies how to assign pay-as-you-go instances and spot instances in a mixed instance mode.
 *
 * @method integer getBaseCapacity() Obtain The minimum number of the scaling group’s capacity that must be fulfilled by pay-as-you-go instances. It defaults to 0 if not specified. Its value cannot exceed the max capacity of the scaling group.
Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method void setBaseCapacity(integer $BaseCapacity) Set The minimum number of the scaling group’s capacity that must be fulfilled by pay-as-you-go instances. It defaults to 0 if not specified. Its value cannot exceed the max capacity of the scaling group.
Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method integer getOnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity() Obtain Controls the percentage of pay-as-you-go instances for the additional capacity beyond `BaseCapacity`. Valid range: 0-100. The value 0 indicates that only spot instances are provisioned, while the value 100 indicates that only pay-as-you-go instances are provisioned. It defaults to 70 if not specified. The number of pay-as-you-go instances calculated on the percentage should be rounded up.
For example, if the desired capacity is 3, the `BaseCapacity` is set to 1, and the `OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity` is set to 1, the scaling group will have 2 pay-as-you-go instance (one comes from the base capacity, and the other comes from the rounded up value of the proportion), and 1 spot instance.
Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method void setOnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity(integer $OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity) Set Controls the percentage of pay-as-you-go instances for the additional capacity beyond `BaseCapacity`. Valid range: 0-100. The value 0 indicates that only spot instances are provisioned, while the value 100 indicates that only pay-as-you-go instances are provisioned. It defaults to 70 if not specified. The number of pay-as-you-go instances calculated on the percentage should be rounded up.

Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method string getSpotAllocationStrategy() Obtain Specifies how to assign spot instances in a mixed instance mode. Valid values: `COST_OPTIMIZED` and `CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`; default value: `COST_OPTIMIZED`.
<br><li>`COST_OPTIMIZED`: the lowest cost policy. For each model in the launch configuration, AS tries to purchase it based on the lowest unit price per core in each availability zone. If the purchase failed, try the second-lowest unit price.
<br><li>`CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`: the optimal capacity policy. For each model in the launch configuration, AS tries to purchase it based on the largest stock in each availability zone, minimizing the automatic repossession probability of spot instances.
Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method void setSpotAllocationStrategy(string $SpotAllocationStrategy) Set Specifies how to assign spot instances in a mixed instance mode. Valid values: `COST_OPTIMIZED` and `CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`; default value: `COST_OPTIMIZED`.
<br><li>`COST_OPTIMIZED`: the lowest cost policy. For each model in the launch configuration, AS tries to purchase it based on the lowest unit price per core in each availability zone. If the purchase failed, try the second-lowest unit price.
<br><li>`CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED`: the optimal capacity policy. For each model in the launch configuration, AS tries to purchase it based on the largest stock in each availability zone, minimizing the automatic repossession probability of spot instances.
Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method boolean getCompensateWithBaseInstance() Obtain Whether to replace with pay-as-you go instances. Valid values:
<br><li>`TRUE`: yes. After the purchase of spot instances failed due to insufficient stock and other reasons, purchase pay-as-you-go instances.
<br><li>`FALSE`: no. The scaling group only tries the configured model of spot instances when it needs to add spot instances.

Default value: `TRUE`.
Note: this field may return `null`, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method void setCompensateWithBaseInstance(boolean $CompensateWithBaseInstance) Set Whether to replace with pay-as-you go instances. Valid values:
<br><li>`TRUE`: yes. After the purchase of spot instances failed due to insufficient stock and other reasons, purchase pay-as-you-go instances.
<br><li>`FALSE`: no. The scaling group only tries the configured model of spot instances when it needs to add spot instances.

Default value: `TRUE`.
