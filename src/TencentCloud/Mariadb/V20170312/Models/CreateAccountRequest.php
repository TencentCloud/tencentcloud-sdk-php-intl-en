 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Instance ID, which is in the format of `tdsql-ow728lmc` and can be obtained through the `DescribeDBInstances` API.
 * @method string getUserName() Obtain Login username, which can contain 1-32 letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.
 * @method void setUserName(string $UserName) Set Login username, which can contain 1-32 letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.
 * @method string getHost() Obtain Host that can be logged in to, which is in the same format as the host of the MySQL account and supports wildcards, such as %, 10.%, and 10.20.%.
 * @method void setHost(string $Host) Set Host that can be logged in to, which is in the same format as the host of the MySQL account and supports wildcards, such as %, 10.%, and 10.20.%.
 * @method string getPassword() Obtain Account password. It must contain 8-32 characters in all of the following four types: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols (()~!@#$%^&*-+=_|{}[]:<>,.?/), and cannot start with a slash (/).

 * @method integer getSlaveConst() Obtain Whether to specify a replica server for read-only account. Valid values: `0` (No replica server is specified, which means that the proxy will select another available replica server to keep connection with the client if the current replica server doesn’t meet the requirement). `1` (The replica server is specified, which means that the connection will be disconnected if the specified replica server doesn’t meet the requirement.)
 * @method void setSlaveConst(integer $SlaveConst) Set Whether to specify a replica server for read-only account. Valid values: `0` (No replica server is specified, which means that the proxy will select another available replica server to keep connection with the client if the current replica server doesn’t meet the requirement). `1` (The replica server is specified, which means that the connection will be disconnected if the specified replica server doesn’t meet the requirement.)
