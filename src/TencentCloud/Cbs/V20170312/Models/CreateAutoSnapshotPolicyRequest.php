 * @method array getPolicy() Obtain The policy for executing the scheduled snapshot.
 * @method void setPolicy(array $Policy) Set The policy for executing the scheduled snapshot.
 * @method string getAutoSnapshotPolicyName() Obtain The name of the scheduled snapshot policy to be created. If it is left empty, the default is 'Not named'. The maximum length cannot exceed 60 bytes.
 * @method void setAutoSnapshotPolicyName(string $AutoSnapshotPolicyName) Set The name of the scheduled snapshot policy to be created. If it is left empty, the default is 'Not named'. The maximum length cannot exceed 60 bytes.
 * @method boolean getIsActivated() Obtain Whether or not the scheduled snapshot policy is activated. FALSE: Not activated. TRUE: Activated. The default value is TRUE.
 * @method void setIsActivated(boolean $IsActivated) Set Whether or not the scheduled snapshot policy is activated. FALSE: Not activated. TRUE: Activated. The default value is TRUE.
 * @method boolean getIsPermanent() Obtain Whether the snapshot created by this scheduled snapshot policy is retained permanently. FALSE: Not retained permanently. TRUE: Retained permanently. The default value is FALSE.
 * @method void setIsPermanent(boolean $IsPermanent) Set Whether the snapshot created by this scheduled snapshot policy is retained permanently. FALSE: Not retained permanently. TRUE: Retained permanently. The default value is FALSE.
 * @method integer getRetentionDays() Obtain The number of days that a snapshot created by this scheduled snapshot policy is retained. The default value is 7. If this parameter is specified, the IsPermanent input parameter can not be TRUE, otherwise a conflict will occur.
 * @method void setRetentionDays(integer $RetentionDays) Set The number of days that a snapshot created by this scheduled snapshot policy is retained. The default value is 7. If this parameter is specified, the IsPermanent input parameter can not be TRUE, otherwise a conflict will occur.
 * @method boolean getDryRun() Obtain Whether to create an execution policy for the scheduled snapshot. TRUE: Only the time of the initial backup needs to be obtained, and no scheduled snapshot policy is actually created. FALSE: Create. The default value is FALSE.
 * @method void setDryRun(boolean $DryRun) Set Whether to create an execution policy for the scheduled snapshot. TRUE: Only the time of the initial backup needs to be obtained, and no scheduled snapshot policy is actually created. FALSE: Create. The default value is FALSE.
