/**
 * Execution policy for scheduled snapshot. It indicates that a scheduled snapshot policy is executed at the specified `Hour` in the days specified by `DayOfWeek` or `DayOfMonth` or once every `IntervalDays` days. Note: `DayOfWeek`, `DayOfMonth`, and `IntervalDays` are mutually exclusive, and only one policy rule can be set.
 *
 * @method array getHour() Obtain Specifies the time that that the scheduled snapshot policy will be triggered. The unit is hour. The value range is [0-23]. 00:00-23:00 is a total of 24 time points that can be selected. 1 indicates 01:00, and so on.
 * @method void setHour(array $Hour) Set Specifies the time that that the scheduled snapshot policy will be triggered. The unit is hour. The value range is [0-23]. 00:00-23:00 is a total of 24 time points that can be selected. 1 indicates 01:00, and so on.
 * @method array getDayOfWeek() Obtain Specifies the days of the week, from Monday to Sunday, on which a scheduled snapshot will be triggered. Value range: [0, 6]. 0 indicates triggering on Sunday, 1-6 indicate triggering on Monday-Saturday.
 * @method void setDayOfWeek(array $DayOfWeek) Set Specifies the days of the week, from Monday to Sunday, on which a scheduled snapshot will be triggered. Value range: [0, 6]. 0 indicates triggering on Sunday, 1-6 indicate triggering on Monday-Saturday.
 * @method array getDayOfMonth() Obtain Specifies the dates of the month on which a scheduled snapshot will be triggered. Value range: [1, 31]. `1` to `31` indicate the specific dates of the month; for example, `5` indicates the 5th day of the month. Note: If you set a date that does not exist in some months such as 29, 30, and 31, these months will be skipped for scheduled snapshot creation.
 * @method void setDayOfMonth(array $DayOfMonth) Set Specifies the dates of the month on which a scheduled snapshot will be triggered. Value range: [1, 31]. `1` to `31` indicate the specific dates of the month; for example, `5` indicates the 5th day of the month. Note: If you set a date that does not exist in some months such as 29, 30, and 31, these months will be skipped for scheduled snapshot creation.
 * @method integer getIntervalDays() Obtain Specifies the interval for creating scheduled snapshots in days. Value range: [1, 365]. For example, if it is set to `5`, scheduled snapshots will be created every 5 days. Note: If you choose to back up by day, the time for the first backup is theoretically the day when the backup policy is created. If the backup policy creation time on the current day is later than the set backup time, the first backup will be performed in the second backup cycle.
 * @method void setIntervalDays(integer $IntervalDays) Set Specifies the interval for creating scheduled snapshots in days. Value range: [1, 365]. For example, if it is set to `5`, scheduled snapshots will be created every 5 days. Note: If you choose to back up by day, the time for the first backup is theoretically the day when the backup policy is created. If the backup policy creation time on the current day is later than the set backup time, the first backup will be performed in the second backup cycle.
