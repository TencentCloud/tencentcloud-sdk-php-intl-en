/**
 * ModifyDiskAttributes request structure.
 *
 * @method array getDiskIds() Obtain IDs of one or more cloud disks to be operated. If multiple cloud disk IDs are selected, it only supports modifying all cloud disks with the same attributes.
 * @method void setDiskIds(array $DiskIds) Set IDs of one or more cloud disks to be operated. If multiple cloud disk IDs are selected, it only supports modifying all cloud disks with the same attributes.
 * @method string getDiskName() Obtain Name of new cloud disk.
 * @method void setDiskName(string $DiskName) Set Name of new cloud disk.
 * @method boolean getPortable() Obtain Whether it is an elastic cloud disk. FALSE: non-elastic cloud disk; TRUE: elastic cloud disk. You can only modify non-elastic cloud disks to elastic cloud disks.
 * @method void setPortable(boolean $Portable) Set Whether it is an elastic cloud disk. FALSE: non-elastic cloud disk; TRUE: elastic cloud disk. You can only modify non-elastic cloud disks to elastic cloud disks.
 * @method integer getProjectId() Obtain The new project ID of the cloud disk. Only the project ID of elastic cloud disk can be modified. The available projects and their IDs can be queried via the API [DescribeProject](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/378/4400?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method void setProjectId(integer $ProjectId) Set The new project ID of the cloud disk. Only the project ID of elastic cloud disk can be modified. The available projects and their IDs can be queried via the API [DescribeProject](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/378/4400?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method boolean getDeleteWithInstance() Obtain Whether the cloud disk is terminated with the CVM after it has been successfully mounted. `TRUE` indicates that it is terminated with the CVM. `FALSE` indicates that it is not terminated with the CVM. This is only supported for cloud disks and data disks that are pay-as-you-go.
 * @method void setDeleteWithInstance(boolean $DeleteWithInstance) Set Whether the cloud disk is terminated with the CVM after it has been successfully mounted. `TRUE` indicates that it is terminated with the CVM. `FALSE` indicates that it is not terminated with the CVM. This is only supported for cloud disks and data disks that are pay-as-you-go.
 * @method string getDiskType() Obtain When changing the type of a cloud disk, this parameter can be passed to indicate the desired cloud disk type. Value range: <br><li>CLOUD_PREMIUM: Premium cloud storage.  <br><li>CLOUD_SSD: SSD cloud disk. <br>Currently, batch operations are not supported for changing type. That is, when `DiskType` is passed, only one cloud disk can be passed through `DiskIds`. <br>When the cloud disk type is changed, the changing of other attributes is not supported concurrently.
 * @method void setDiskType(string $DiskType) Set When changing the type of a cloud disk, this parameter can be passed to indicate the desired cloud disk type. Value range: <br><li>CLOUD_PREMIUM: Premium cloud storage.  <br><li>CLOUD_SSD: SSD cloud disk. <br>Currently, batch operations are not supported for changing type. That is, when `DiskType` is passed, only one cloud disk can be passed through `DiskIds`. <br>When the cloud disk type is changed, the changing of other attributes is not supported concurrently.
 * @method string getBurstPerformanceOperation() Obtain Enable/disable disk bursting.
 * @method void setBurstPerformanceOperation(string $BurstPerformanceOperation) Set Enable/disable disk bursting.
