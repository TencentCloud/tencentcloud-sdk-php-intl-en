 * @method string getCdcName() Obtain Dedicated cluster name. When it is an input parameter, it is ignored.  When it is an output parameter, it is the name of the dedicated cluster the cloud disk belongs to, and it can be left blank.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value was found.
 * @method void setCdcName(string $CdcName) Set Dedicated cluster name. When it is an input parameter, it is ignored.  When it is an output parameter, it is the name of the dedicated cluster the cloud disk belongs to, and it can be left blank.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value was found.
 * @method string getCdcId() Obtain ID of dedicated cluster which the instance belongs to. When it is an input parameter, the specified CdcId dedicated cluster resource is operated, and it can be left blank. When it is an output parameter, it is the ID of the dedicated cluster which the resource belongs to, and it can be left blank.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value was found.
 * @method void setCdcId(string $CdcId) Set ID of dedicated cluster which the instance belongs to. When it is an input parameter, the specified CdcId dedicated cluster resource is operated, and it can be left blank. When it is an output parameter, it is the ID of the dedicated cluster which the resource belongs to, and it can be left blank.
