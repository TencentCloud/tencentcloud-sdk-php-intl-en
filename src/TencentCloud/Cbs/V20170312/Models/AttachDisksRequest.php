 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set ID of the CVM instance on which the cloud disk will be mounted. It can be queried via the API [DescribeInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method array getDiskIds() Obtain ID of the elastic cloud disk to be mounted, which can be queried through the API [DescribeDisks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/16315?from_cn_redirect=1). A maximum of 10 elastic cloud disks can be mounted in a single request.
 * @method void setDiskIds(array $DiskIds) Set ID of the elastic cloud disk to be mounted, which can be queried through the API [DescribeDisks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/16315?from_cn_redirect=1). A maximum of 10 elastic cloud disks can be mounted in a single request.
 * @method boolean getDeleteWithInstance() Obtain Optional parameter. If this is not passed only the mount operation is executed. If `True` is passed, the cloud disk will be configured to be terminated when the server it is mounted to is terminated. This is only valid for pay-as-you-go cloud disks.
 * @method void setDeleteWithInstance(boolean $DeleteWithInstance) Set Optional parameter. If this is not passed only the mount operation is executed. If `True` is passed, the cloud disk will be configured to be terminated when the server it is mounted to is terminated. This is only valid for pay-as-you-go cloud disks.
 * @method string getAttachMode() Obtain (Optional) Specifies the cloud disk mounting method. It’s only valid for BM models. Valid values: <br><li>PF<br><li>VF
 * @method void setAttachMode(string $AttachMode) Set (Optional) Specifies the cloud disk mounting method. It’s only valid for BM models. Valid values: <br><li>PF<br><li>VF
