traffic: traffic bandwidth;

 * @method void setMetricName(string $MetricName) Set Metric name. Valid values:
traffic: traffic bandwidth;
pkg: packet rate;
 * @method integer getPeriod() Obtain Statistical time granularity (300: 5-minute, 3600: hourly, 86400: daily)
 * @method void setPeriod(integer $Period) Set Statistical time granularity (300: 5-minute, 3600: hourly, 86400: daily)
