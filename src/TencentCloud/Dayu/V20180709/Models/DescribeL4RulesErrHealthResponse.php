 * @method array getErrHealths() Obtain Exceptional rule list. Returned value description: `Key` is the rule ID, while `Value` is the exceptional IP. Multiple IPs are separated by ","
 * @method void setErrHealths(array $ErrHealths) Set Exceptional rule list. Returned value description: `Key` is the rule ID, while `Value` is the exceptional IP. Multiple IPs are separated by ","
 * @method array getExtErrHealths() Obtain Exceptional rule list (which provides more error-related information). Returned value description:

If `key` is `VirtualPort`, `Value` indicates the forwarding port of a rule;
If `Key` is `ErrMessage`, `Value` indicates the exception message for health check;
Exception message for health check in the format of `"SourceIp:1.1.1.1|SourcePort:1234|AbnormalStatTime:1570689065|AbnormalReason:connection time out|Interval:20|CheckNum:6|FailNum:6"`. Multiple error messages for the source IP should be separated by `,`,
