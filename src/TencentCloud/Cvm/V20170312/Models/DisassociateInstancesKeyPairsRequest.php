 * DisassociateInstancesKeyPairs request structure.

 * @method array getInstanceIds() Obtain Instance ID(s). The maximum number of instances in each request is 100. <br><br>You can obtain the available instance IDs in two ways: <br><li>Log in to the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index) to query the instance IDs. <br><li>Call [DescribeInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `InstanceId` in the response.
 * @method void setInstanceIds(array $InstanceIds) Set Instance ID(s). The maximum number of instances in each request is 100. <br><br>You can obtain the available instance IDs in two ways: <br><li>Log in to the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index) to query the instance IDs. <br><li>Call [DescribeInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `InstanceId` in the response.
 * @method array getKeyIds() Obtain List of key pair IDs. The maximum number of key pairs in each request is 100. The key pair ID is in the format of `skey-11112222`. <br><br>You can obtain the available key pair IDs in two ways: <br><li>Log in to the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/sshkey) to query the key pair IDs. <br><li>Call [DescribeKeyPairs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15699?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `KeyId` in the response.

 * @method boolean getForceStop() Obtain Whether to force shut down a running instances. It is recommended to manually shut down a running instance before disassociating a key pair from it. Valid values: <br><li>TRUE: force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><li>FALSE: do not force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><br>Default value: FALSE.

It is recommended to manually shut down a running instance before disassociating a key pair from it. Valid values: <br><li>TRUE: force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><li>FALSE: do not force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><br>Default value: FALSE.
