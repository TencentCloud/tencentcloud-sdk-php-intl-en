/**
 * Describes login settings of an instance.
 *
 * @method string getPassword() Obtain Instance login password. The password complexity limits vary with the operating system type as follows: <br><li>The Linux instance password must be 8 to 30 characters long and include at least two of the following: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], and special characters of [( ) \` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | { } [ ] : ; ' , . ? / ]. <br><li>The Windows instance password must be 12 to 30 characters long and include at least three of the following: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], and special characters [( ) \` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | { } [ ] : ; ' , . ? /]. <br><br>If this parameter is not specified, you need to set it before login by using the console to "reset password" or by calling the ResetInstancesPassword API.
 * @method void setPassword(string $Password) Set Instance login password. The password complexity limits vary with the operating system type as follows: <br><li>The Linux instance password must be 8 to 30 characters long and include at least two of the following: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], and special characters of [( ) \` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | { } [ ] : ; ' , . ? / ]. <br><li>The Windows instance password must be 12 to 30 characters long and include at least three of the following: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], and special characters [( ) \` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | { } [ ] : ; ' , . ? /]. <br><br>If this parameter is not specified, you need to set it before login by using the console to "reset password" or by calling the ResetInstancesPassword API.
 * @method array getKeyIds() Obtain List of key IDs. After an instance is associated with a key, you can access the instance with the private key in the key pair. You can call [`DescribeKeyPairs`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15699?from_cn_redirect=1) to obtain `KeyId`. You cannot specify a key and a password at the same time. Windows instances do not support keys.
Note: This field may return `null`, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setKeyIds(array $KeyIds) Set List of key IDs. After an instance is associated with a key, you can access the instance with the private key in the key pair. You can call [`DescribeKeyPairs`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15699?from_cn_redirect=1) to obtain `KeyId`. You cannot specify a key and a password at the same time. Windows instances do not support keys.
Note: This field may return `null`, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getKeepImageLogin() Obtain Retain the original settings of the image. this parameter cannot be specified simultaneously with Password or KeyIds.N. it can be set to true only when an instance is created with a custom image, shared image, or externally imported image. value ranges from true to false: <li>true: indicates that the login settings of the image are retained</li><li>false: indicates that the login settings of the image are not retained</li>. default value: false.
 * @method void setKeepImageLogin(string $KeepImageLogin) Set Retain the original settings of the image. this parameter cannot be specified simultaneously with Password or KeyIds.N. it can be set to true only when an instance is created with a custom image, shared image, or externally imported image. value ranges from true to false: <li>true: indicates that the login settings of the image are retained</li><li>false: indicates that the login settings of the image are not retained</li>. default value: false.
