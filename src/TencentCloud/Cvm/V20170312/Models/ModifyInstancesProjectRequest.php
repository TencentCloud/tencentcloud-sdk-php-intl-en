You can operate up to 100 instances in each request.
 * @method integer getProjectId() Obtain Project ID. You can use the API `AddProject` to create projects, and obtain the `projectId` field in the response of the `DescribeProject` API. When using the [DescribeInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) API to query instances later, you can filter the results by the project ID.
