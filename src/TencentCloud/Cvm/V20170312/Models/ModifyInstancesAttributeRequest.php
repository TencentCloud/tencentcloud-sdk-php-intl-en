/**
 * ModifyInstancesAttribute request structure.
 *
 * @method array getInstanceIds() Obtain Instance ID(s). To obtain the instance IDs, you can call [`DescribeInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `InstanceId` in the response. The maximum number of instances in each request is 100.
 * @method void setInstanceIds(array $InstanceIds) Set Instance ID(s). To obtain the instance IDs, you can call [`DescribeInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `InstanceId` in the response. The maximum number of instances in each request is 100.
 * @method string getInstanceName() Obtain The instance name, which can not exceed 60 characters
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">Either `InstanceName` or `SecurityGroups` must be specified, but they can not be both specified.</dx-alert>
 * @method void setInstanceName(string $InstanceName) Set The instance name, which can not exceed 60 characters
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">Either `InstanceName` or `SecurityGroups` must be specified, but they can not be both specified.</dx-alert>
 * @method string getUserData() Obtain User data provided to an instance, which needs to be encoded in Base64 format with a maximum size of 16 KB. For details on obtaining this parameter, refer to the startup commands for [Windows](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17526?from_cn_redirect=1) and [Linux](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17525?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method void setUserData(string $UserData) Set User data provided to an instance, which needs to be encoded in Base64 format with a maximum size of 16 KB. For details on obtaining this parameter, refer to the startup commands for [Windows](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17526?from_cn_redirect=1) and [Linux](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17525?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method array getSecurityGroups() Obtain IDs of security groups associated with the specified instance. You can associate with a security group by adding its ID, or cancel the association with a security group by removing its ID. <dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">Either `InstanceName` or `SecurityGroups` must be specified, but they cannot be both set.</dx-alert>
 * @method void setSecurityGroups(array $SecurityGroups) Set IDs of security groups associated with the specified instance. You can associate with a security group by adding its ID, or cancel the association with a security group by removing its ID. <dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">Either `InstanceName` or `SecurityGroups` must be specified, but they cannot be both set.</dx-alert>
 * @method string getCamRoleName() Obtain The role bound with the instance. If it is not specified, it indicates to unbind the current role of the CVM.
 * @method void setCamRoleName(string $CamRoleName) Set The role bound with the instance. If it is not specified, it indicates to unbind the current role of the CVM.
 * @method string getHostName() Obtain Modified hostname of an instance.<li>Period (.) and hyphen (-) should not be used as the first or last character of the hostname, and should not be used consecutively.</li><li>Windows instances: The hostname should contain 2 to 15 characters, including letters (case insensitive), digits, and hyphens (-), does not support periods (.), and should not be all digits.</li><li>Instances of other types (such as Linux instances): The hostname should contain 2 to 60 characters, including multiple periods (.), with each segment between periods considered as one section. Each section can contain letters (case insensitive), digits, and hyphens (-).</li>Note: After the hostname is modified, the instance will restart immediately, and the new hostname will take effect after the restart.
 * @method void setHostName(string $HostName) Set Modified hostname of an instance.<li>Period (.) and hyphen (-) should not be used as the first or last character of the hostname, and should not be used consecutively.</li><li>Windows instances: The hostname should contain 2 to 15 characters, including letters (case insensitive), digits, and hyphens (-), does not support periods (.), and should not be all digits.</li><li>Instances of other types (such as Linux instances): The hostname should contain 2 to 60 characters, including multiple periods (.), with each segment between periods considered as one section. Each section can contain letters (case insensitive), digits, and hyphens (-).</li>Note: After the hostname is modified, the instance will restart immediately, and the new hostname will take effect after the restart.
 * @method boolean getDisableApiTermination() Obtain Instance termination protection flag, indicating whether an instance is allowed to be deleted through an API. Valid values:<li>true: Instance protection is enabled, and the instance is not allowed to be deleted through the API.</li><li>false: Instance protection is disabled, and the instance is allowed to be deleted through the API.</li>Default value: false.
 * @method void setDisableApiTermination(boolean $DisableApiTermination) Set Instance termination protection flag, indicating whether an instance is allowed to be deleted through an API. Valid values:<li>true: Instance protection is enabled, and the instance is not allowed to be deleted through the API.</li><li>false: Instance protection is disabled, and the instance is allowed to be deleted through the API.</li>Default value: false.
 * @method string getCamRoleType() Obtain The role type, which is used in conjunction with `CamRoleName`. The value is obtained in `RoleType` field, returning by `CAM DescribeRoleList` and `GetRole` APIs. Valid value: `user`, `system` and `service_linked`.
For example, when `LinkedRoleIn` is contained in `CamRoleName` (such as `TKE_QCSLinkedRoleInPrometheusService`), the returned `RoleType` of `DescribeRoleList` and `GetRoleis` is `service_linked`, and the `CamRoleType` `service_linked`.
When the value obtained in `RoleType` is `user` (default) or `system`, `CamRoleType` can be left empty.
 * @method void setCamRoleType(string $CamRoleType) Set The role type, which is used in conjunction with `CamRoleName`. The value is obtained in `RoleType` field, returning by `CAM DescribeRoleList` and `GetRole` APIs. Valid value: `user`, `system` and `service_linked`.
For example, when `LinkedRoleIn` is contained in `CamRoleName` (such as `TKE_QCSLinkedRoleInPrometheusService`), the returned `RoleType` of `DescribeRoleList` and `GetRoleis` is `service_linked`, and the `CamRoleType` `service_linked`.
When the value obtained in `RoleType` is `user` (default) or `system`, `CamRoleType` can be left empty.
 * @method boolean getAutoReboot() Obtain Whether to automatically restart an instance when modifying a hostname. If not specified, the instance will automatically restart by default.
- true: Modify the hostname and automatically restart the instance.
- false: Modify the hostname without automatically restarting the instance. A manual restart is required for the new hostname to take effect.
Note: This parameter is valid only when a hostname is modified.
 * @method void setAutoReboot(boolean $AutoReboot) Set Whether to automatically restart an instance when modifying a hostname. If not specified, the instance will automatically restart by default.
- true: Modify the hostname and automatically restart the instance.
- false: Modify the hostname without automatically restarting the instance. A manual restart is required for the new hostname to take effect.
