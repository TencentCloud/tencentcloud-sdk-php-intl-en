/**
 * ResetInstancesType request structure.
 *
 * @method array getInstanceIds() Obtain Instance ID(s). To obtain the instance IDs, you can call the [`DescribeInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) API and find the value `InstanceId` in the response. The maximum number of instances in each request is 1.
 * @method void setInstanceIds(array $InstanceIds) Set Instance ID(s). To obtain the instance IDs, you can call the [`DescribeInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) API and find the value `InstanceId` in the response. The maximum number of instances in each request is 1.
 * @method string getInstanceType() Obtain Instance model. Different resource specifications are specified for different models. For specific values, call [DescribeInstanceTypeConfigs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15749?from_cn_redirect=1) to get the latest specification list or refer to [Instance Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method void setInstanceType(string $InstanceType) Set Instance model. Different resource specifications are specified for different models. For specific values, call [DescribeInstanceTypeConfigs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15749?from_cn_redirect=1) to get the latest specification list or refer to [Instance Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518?from_cn_redirect=1).
 * @method boolean getForceStop() Obtain Forced shutdown of a running instances. We recommend you firstly try to shut down a running instance manually. Valid values: <br><li>TRUE: forced shutdown of an instance after a normal shutdown fails.<br><li>FALSE: no forced shutdown of an instance after a normal shutdown fails.<br><br>Default value: FALSE.<br><br>A forced shutdown is similar to switching off the power of a physical computer. It may cause data loss or file system corruption. Be sure to only force a CVM to shut off if the normal shutdown fails.
 * @method void setForceStop(boolean $ForceStop) Set Forced shutdown of a running instances. We recommend you firstly try to shut down a running instance manually.
