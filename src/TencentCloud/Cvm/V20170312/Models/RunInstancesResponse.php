 * RunInstances response structure.
 *
 * @method array getInstanceIdSet() Obtain If you use this API to create instance(s), this parameter will be returned, representing one or more instance IDs. Retuning the instance ID list does not necessarily mean that the instance(s) were created successfully. To check whether the instance(s) were created successfully, you can call [DescribeInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and check the status of the instances in `InstancesSet` in the response. If the status of an instance changes from "PENDING" to "RUNNING", it means that the instance has been created successfully.
 * @method void setInstanceIdSet(array $InstanceIdSet) Set If you use this API to create instance(s), this parameter will be returned, representing one or more instance IDs. Retuning the instance ID list does not necessarily mean that the instance(s) were created successfully. To check whether the instance(s) were created successfully, you can call [DescribeInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and check the status of the instances in `InstancesSet` in the response. If the status of an instance changes from "PENDING" to "RUNNING", it means that the instance has been created successfully.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
