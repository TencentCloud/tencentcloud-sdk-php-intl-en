/**
 * ResizeInstanceDisks request structure.
 *
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Instance ID. To obtain the instance IDs, you can call [`DescribeInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `InstanceId` in the response.
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Instance ID. To obtain the instance IDs, you can call [`DescribeInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `InstanceId` in the response.
 * @method array getDataDisks() Obtain Configuration of data disks to be expanded. Currently you can only use the API to expand non-elastic data disks whose [disk type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/9452?from_cn_redirect=1#block_device) is `CLOUD_BASIC`, `CLOUD_PREMIUM`, or `CLOUD_SSD`. You can use [`DescribeDisks`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/362/16315?from_cn_redirect=1) to check whether a disk is elastic. If the `Portable` field in the response is `false`, it means that the disk is not elastic. Data disk capacity unit: GB; minimum increment: 10 GB. For more information on selecting the data disk type, see the [product overview on cloud disks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/2353?from_cn_redirect=1). Available data disk types are subject to the instance type (`InstanceType`). In addition, the maximum capacity allowed for expansion varies by data disk type.
 * @method void setDataDisks(array $DataDisks) Set Configuration of data disks to be expanded. Currently you can only use the API to expand non-elastic data disks whose [disk type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/9452?from_cn_redirect=1#block_device) is `CLOUD_BASIC`, `CLOUD_PREMIUM`, or `CLOUD_SSD`. You can use [`DescribeDisks`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/362/16315?from_cn_redirect=1) to check whether a disk is elastic.

Available data disk types are subject to the instance type (`InstanceType`). In addition, the maximum capacity allowed for expansion varies by data disk type.
 * @method boolean getForceStop() Obtain Whether to force shut down a running instances. It is recommended to manually shut down a running instance before resetting the user password. Valid values: <br><li>TRUE: force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><li>FALSE: do not force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><br>Default value: FALSE. <br><br>A forced shutdown is similar to switching off the power of a physical computer. It may cause data loss or file system corruption. Be sure to only force shut down a CVM when it cannot be shut down normally.
 * @method void setForceStop(boolean $ForceStop) Set Whether to force shut down a running instances. It is recommended to manually shut down a running instance before resetting the user password. Valid values: <br><li>TRUE: force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><li>FALSE: do not force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><br>Default value: FALSE. <br><br>A forced shutdown is similar to switching off the power of a physical computer. It may cause data loss or file system corruption. Be sure to only force shut down a CVM when it cannot be shut down normally.
 * @method SystemDisk getSystemDisk() Obtain Configuration of the system disk to be expanded. Only cloud disks are supported.
 * @method void setSystemDisk(SystemDisk $SystemDisk) Set Configuration of the system disk to be expanded. Only cloud disks are supported.
 * @method boolean getResizeOnline() Obtain Whether the cloud disk is expanded online.
 * @method void setResizeOnline(boolean $ResizeOnline) Set Whether the cloud disk is expanded online.
