/**
 * ResetInstancesPassword request structure.
 *
 * @method array getInstanceIds() Obtain Instance ID(s). To obtain the instance IDs, you can call [`DescribeInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `InstanceId` in the response. The maximum number of instances in each request is 100.
 * @method void setInstanceIds(array $InstanceIds) Set Instance ID(s). To obtain the instance IDs, you can call [`DescribeInstances`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728?from_cn_redirect=1) and look for `InstanceId` in the response. The maximum number of instances in each request is 100.
 * @method string getPassword() Obtain Login password of the instance. The password requirements vary among different operating systems:
For a Linux instance, the password must be 8 to 30 characters in length; password with more than 12 characters is recommended. It cannot begin with "/", and must contain at least one character from three of the following categories: <br><li>Lowercase letters: [a-z]<br><li>Uppercase letters: [A-Z]<br><li>Numbers: 0-9<br><li>Special characters: ()\`\~!@#$%^&\*-+=\_|{}[]:;'<>,.?/
For a Windows CVM, the password must be 12 to 30 characters in length. It cannot begin with "/" or contain a username. It must contain at least one character from three of the following categories: <br><li>Lowercase letters: [a-z]<br><li>Uppercase letters: [A-Z]<br><li>Numbers: 0-9<br><li>Special characters: ()\`\~!@#$%^&\*-+=\_|{}[]:;' <>,.?/<br><li>If the specified instances include both `Linux` and `Windows` instances, you will need to follow the password requirements for `Windows` instances.
 * @method void setPassword(string $Password) Set Login password of the instance. The password requirements vary among different operating systems:
For a Linux instance, the password must be 8 to 30 characters in length; password with more than 12 characters is recommended. It cannot begin with "/", and must contain at least one character from three of the following categories: <br><li>Lowercase letters: [a-z]<br><li>Uppercase letters: [A-Z]<br><li>Numbers: 0-9<br><li>Special characters: ()\`\~!@#$%^&\*-+=\_|{}[]:;'<>,.?/

 * @method string getUserName() Obtain Username of the instance operating system for which the password needs to be reset. This parameter is limited to 64 characters.
 * @method void setUserName(string $UserName) Set Username of the instance operating system for which the password needs to be reset. This parameter is limited to 64 characters.
 * @method boolean getForceStop() Obtain Whether to force shut down a running instances. It is recommended to manually shut down a running instance before resetting the user password. Valid values: <br><li>TRUE: force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><li>FALSE: do not force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><br>Default value: FALSE. <br><br>A forced shutdown is similar to switching off the power of a physical computer. It may cause data loss or file system corruption. Be sure to only force shut down a CVM when it cannot be shut down normally.
 * @method void setForceStop(boolean $ForceStop) Set Whether to force shut down a running instances. It is recommended to manually shut down a running instance before resetting the user password. Valid values: <br><li>TRUE: force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><li>FALSE: do not force shut down an instance after a normal shutdown fails. <br><br>Default value: FALSE. <br><br>A forced shutdown is similar to switching off the power of a physical computer.
