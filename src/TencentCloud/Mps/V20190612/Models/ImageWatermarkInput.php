/**
 * Input parameter of an image watermarking template
 *
 * @method string getImageContent() Obtain String generated by [Base64-encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648) a watermark image. JPEG and PNG images are supported.
 * @method void setImageContent(string $ImageContent) Set String generated by [Base64-encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648) a watermark image. JPEG and PNG images are supported.
 * @method string getWidth() Obtain Width of a watermark, supporting two formats: % and px.
<li>If a string ends with %, it indicates that the `Width` of a watermark is a percentage of a video's width. For example, `10%` means that `Width` is 10% of a video's width.</li>
<li>If a string ends with px, the `Width` of a watermark will be in pixels. For example, `100px` means that `Width` is 100 pixels. Value range: [8, 4096].</li>

When width and height are not specified or set to 0, the default value is 10%.
 * @method void setWidth(string $Width) Set Width of a watermark, supporting two formats: % and px.
<li>If a string ends with %, it indicates that the `Width` of a watermark is a percentage of a video's width. For example, `10%` means that `Width` is 10% of a video's width.</li>
<li>If a string ends with px, the `Width` of a watermark will be in pixels. For example, `100px` means that `Width` is 100 pixels. Value range: [8, 4096].</li>

When width and height are not specified or set to 0, the default value is 10%.
 * @method string getHeight() Obtain Watermark height. % and px formats are supported:
<li>If the string ends in %, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height. For example, `10%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Height` of the watermark will be in pixels. For example, `100px` means that `Height` is 100 pixels. Value range: 0 or [8, 4096].</li>
Default value: 0px, which means that `Height` will be proportionally scaled according to the aspect ratio of the original watermark image.
 * @method void setHeight(string $Height) Set Watermark height. % and px formats are supported:
<li>If the string ends in %, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height. For example, `10%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Height` of the watermark will be in pixels. For example, `100px` means that `Height` is 100 pixels. Value range: 0 or [8, 4096].</li>
Default value: 0px, which means that `Height` will be proportionally scaled according to the aspect ratio of the original watermark image.
 * @method string getRepeatType() Obtain Repeat type of an animated watermark. Valid values:
<li>once: no longer appears after watermark playback ends.</li>
<li>repeat_last_frame: stays on the last frame after watermark playback ends.</li>
<li>repeat (default): repeats the playback until the video ends.</li>
 * @method void setRepeatType(string $RepeatType) Set Repeat type of an animated watermark. Valid values:
<li>once: no longer appears after watermark playback ends.</li>
<li>repeat_last_frame: stays on the last frame after watermark playback ends.</li>
<li>repeat (default): repeats the playback until the video ends.</li>
