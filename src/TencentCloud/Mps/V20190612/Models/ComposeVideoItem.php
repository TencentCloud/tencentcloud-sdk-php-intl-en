 * The video element information of a video editing/compositing task.
 *
 * @method ComposeSourceMedia getSourceMedia() Obtain The media information of the element.
 * @method void setSourceMedia(ComposeSourceMedia $SourceMedia) Set The media information of the element.
 * @method ComposeTrackTime getTrackTime() Obtain The time of the element in the timeline. If this is not specified, the element will follow the previous element.
 * @method void setTrackTime(ComposeTrackTime $TrackTime) Set The time of the element in the timeline. If this is not specified, the element will follow the previous element.
 * @method string getXPos() Obtain The horizontal distance of the element's center from the canvas origin. Two formats are supported:
<li>If the value ends with %, it specifies the distance as a percentage of the canvas width. For example, `10%` means that the distance is 10% of the canvas width. </li>
u200c<li>If the value ends with px, it specifies the distance in pixels. For example, `100px` means that the distance is 100 pixels. </li>
Default value: `50%`.
