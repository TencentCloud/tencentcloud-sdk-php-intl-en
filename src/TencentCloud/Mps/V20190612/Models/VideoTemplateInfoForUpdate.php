 * @method integer getContentAdaptStream() Obtain Whether to enable adaptive encoding. Valid values:
<li>0: Disable</li>
<li>1: Enable</li>
Default value: 0. If this parameter is set to `1`, multiple streams with different resolutions and bitrates will be generated automatically. The highest resolution, bitrate, and quality of the streams are determined by the values of `width` and `height`, `Bitrate`, and `Vcrf` in `VideoTemplate` respectively. If these parameters are not set in `VideoTemplate`, the highest resolution generated will be the same as that of the source video, and the highest video quality will be close to VMAF 95. To use this parameter or learn about the billing details of adaptive encoding, please contact your sales rep.
 * @method void setContentAdaptStream(integer $ContentAdaptStream) Set Whether to enable adaptive encoding. Valid values:
<li>0: Disable</li>
<li>1: Enable</li>
Default value: 0. If this parameter is set to `1`, multiple streams with different resolutions and bitrates will be generated automatically. The highest resolution, bitrate, and quality of the streams are determined by the values of `width` and `height`, `Bitrate`, and `Vcrf` in `VideoTemplate` respectively.
