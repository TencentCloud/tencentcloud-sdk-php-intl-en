Default value: normal.
Note: To use this value, the value of ScenarioBased must be 1; otherwise, this value will not take effect.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
     * @param string $CompressType Transcoding policy. Valid values: 
ultra_compress: Extreme compression: Compared to standard compression, this policy can maximize bitrate compression while ensuring a certain level of image quality, thus greatly saving bandwidth and storage costs. 
standard_compress: Comprehensively optimal: Balances compression ratio and image quality, compressing files as much as possible without a noticeable reduction in subjective image quality. This policy only charges audio and video TSC transcoding fees. 
high_compress: Bitrate priority: Prioritizes reducing file size, which may result in some image quality loss. This policy only charges audio and video TSC transcoding fees. 
low_compress: Image quality priority: Prioritizes ensuring image quality, and the size of compressed files may be relatively large. This policy only charges audio and video TSC transcoding fees. 
Default value: standard_compress. 
Note: If you need to watch videos on TV, it is recommended not to use the ultra_compress policy. The billing standard for the ultra_compress policy is TSC transcoding + audio and video enhancement - artifacts removal.
Note: To use this value, the value of ScenarioBased must be 1; otherwise, this value will not take effect.
