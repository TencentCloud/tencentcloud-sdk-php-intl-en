/**
 * Audio track info.
 *
 * @method string getTrackNum() Obtain The serial number of the audio track and sound channel.
<li>When the value of SelectType is track, this value is an integer, for example: 1.
<li>When the value of SelectType is track_channel, this value is a decimal, for example: 1.0.
<li>Default value: 1.0.
The integer part represents the audio track serial number, and the decimal part represents the sound channel. The audio track serial number is the stream index value of the audio track, which can be 0 or a positive integer. The decimal part supports up to 2 decimal places, and only 0 - 63 is supported. However, when the Codec is aac/eac3/ac3, only 0 - 15 is supported for the decimal part. For example: for an audio track with a stream index value of 1, 1.0 represents the first sound channel of this audio track, and 1.1 represents the second sound channel of this audio track.

Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method void setTrackNum(string $TrackNum) Set The serial number of the audio track and sound channel.
<li>When the value of SelectType is track, this value is an integer, for example: 1.
<li>When the value of SelectType is track_channel, this value is a decimal, for example: 1.0.
<li>Default value: 1.0.

Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method array getChannelVolume() Obtain The volume of the sound channel.
<li>When the value of AudioChannel is 1, the length of this array is 1. For example: [6].
<li>When the value of AudioChannel is 2, the length of this array is 2. For example: [0,6].
<li>When the value of AudioChannel is 6, the length of this array is greater than 2 and less than 16. For example: [-60,0,0,6].

Please specify the value array for this parameter. The value range is between -60 and 6, where -60 indicates mute, 0 maintains the original volume, and 6 doubles the original volume. The default value is -60. Please note: This field supports up to 3 decimal places.

Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value can be obtained.
 * @method void setChannelVolume(array $ChannelVolume) Set The volume of the sound channel.
<li>When the value of AudioChannel is 1, the length of this array is 1. For example: [6].
