 * Image watermarking template
 *
 * @method string getImageUrl() Obtain Watermark image address.
 * @method void setImageUrl(string $ImageUrl) Set Watermark image address.
 * @method string getWidth() Obtain Watermark width. % and px formats are supported:
<li>If the string ends in %, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video width; for example, `10%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video width;</li>
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Width` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Width` is 100 px.</li>
 * @method void setWidth(string $Width) Set Watermark width. % and px formats are supported:
<li>If the string ends in %, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video width; for example, `10%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video width;</li>
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Width` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Width` is 100 px.</li>
 * @method string getHeight() Obtain Watermark height. % and px formats are supported:
<li>If the string ends in %, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height. For example, `10%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Height` of the watermark will be in pixels. For example, `100px` means that `Height` is 100 pixels.</li>
`0px` means that `Height` will be proportionally scaled according to the video width.
 * @method void setHeight(string $Height) Set Watermark height. % and px formats are supported:
<li>If the string ends in %, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height. For example, `10%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Height` of the watermark will be in pixels. For example, `100px` means that `Height` is 100 pixels.</li>
`0px` means that `Height` will be proportionally scaled according to the video width.
 * @method string getRepeatType() Obtain Repeat type of an animated watermark. Valid values:
<li>once: no longer appears after watermark playback ends.</li>
<li>repeat_last_frame: stays on the last frame after watermark playback ends.</li>
<li>repeat (default): repeats the playback until the video ends.</li>
 * @method void setRepeatType(string $RepeatType) Set Repeat type of an animated watermark. Valid values:
<li>once: no longer appears after watermark playback ends.</li>
<li>repeat_last_frame: stays on the last frame after watermark playback ends.</li>
<li>repeat (default): repeats the playback until the video ends.</li>
