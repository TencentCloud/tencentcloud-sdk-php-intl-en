/**
 * The time information of an element on the output video track of a video editing/compositing task.
 *
 * @method string getStart() Obtain The time when the element starts on the track.
<li>The value of this parameter ends with `s`, which means seconds. For example, `3.5s` indicates the time when 3.5 seconds of the video elapses.</li>
Note: If this parameter is not specified, the start time will be the end time of the previous element. Therefore, you can also use the placeholder parameter `ComposeEmptyItem` to configure the start time.
 * @method void setStart(string $Start) Set The time when the element starts on the track.
<li>The value of this parameter ends with `s`, which means seconds. For example, `3.5s` indicates the time when 3.5 seconds of the video elapses.</li>
Note: If this parameter is not specified, the start time will be the end time of the previous element. Therefore, you can also use the placeholder parameter `ComposeEmptyItem` to configure the start time.
 * @method string getDuration() Obtain The element duration.
<li>The value of this parameter ends with `s`, which means seconds. For example, `3.5s` means 3.5 seconds.</li>
The default value is the material duration, which is determined by `EndTime` and `StartTime` of `ComposeSourceMedia`. If `ComposeSourceMedia` is not specified, the duration will be 1 second.
 * @method void setDuration(string $Duration) Set The element duration.
<li>The value of this parameter ends with `s`, which means seconds. For example, `3.5s` means 3.5 seconds.</li>
The default value is the material duration, which is determined by `EndTime` and `StartTime` of `ComposeSourceMedia`. If `ComposeSourceMedia` is not specified, the duration will be 1 second.
