 * @method ComposeTargetInfo getTargetInfo() Obtain The information of the output video.
 * @method void setTargetInfo(ComposeTargetInfo $TargetInfo) Set The information of the output video.
 * @method ComposeCanvas getCanvas() Obtain The canvas information of the output video.
 * @method void setCanvas(ComposeCanvas $Canvas) Set The canvas information of the output video.
 * @method array getStyles() Obtain The global styles. This parameter is used together with `Tracks` to specify styles, such as the subtitle style.
 * @method void setStyles(array $Styles) Set The global styles. This parameter is used together with `Tracks` to specify styles, such as the subtitle style.
 * @method array getTracks() Obtain The information of media tracks (consisting of video, audio, image, and text elements) used to composite the video. About tracks and the timeline:
<ul><li>The timeline of a track is the same as the timeline of the output video. </li><li>The elements of different tracks are overlaid at the same time point in the timeline.</li><ul><li>Video, image, and text elements are overlaid according to their track number, with the first track on top. </li><li>Audio elements are mixed. </li></ul></ul>Note: The different elements of the same track cannot be overlaid (except subtitles).

<ul><li>The timeline of a track is the same as the timeline of the output video. </li><li>The elements of different tracks are overlaid at the same time point in the timeline.</li><ul><li>Video, image, and text elements are overlaid according to their track number, with the first track on top. </li><li>Audio elements are mixed. </li></ul></ul>Note: The different elements of the same track cannot be overlaid (except subtitles).
