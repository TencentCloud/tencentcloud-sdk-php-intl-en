`ON`: On.
`OFF`: Off.
 * @method string getBeginTime() Obtain Alert start time in the format of "HH:mm"

The control switch can be high, medium, or low, corresponding to the third, second, and first binary bit, respectively. Valid values: `0` (off); `1` (on).
For example, if the high and medium levels indicate to enable the alert and the low level indicates to disable it, the binary value is `110`.
If level control does not take effect for the alert type, pass in `1`.
