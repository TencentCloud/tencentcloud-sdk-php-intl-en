 * @method array getCommandIds() Obtain List of command IDs. Up to 100 IDs are allowed for each request. `CommandIds` and `Filters` cannot be specified at the same time.
 * @method void setCommandIds(array $CommandIds) Set List of command IDs. Up to 100 IDs are allowed for each request. `CommandIds` and `Filters` cannot be specified at the same time.
 * @method array getFilters() Obtain Filter conditions.
<li> `command-id` - String - Required: No - (Filter condition) Filter by the command ID.
<li> `command-name` - String - Required: No - (Filter condition) Filter by the command name.
<li> `command-type` - String - Required: No - (Filter condition) Filter by the command type. Valid values: `SHELL` or `POWERSHELL`.
<li> `created-by` - String - Required: No - (Filter condition) Filter by the creator. Valid values: `TAT` (public commands) or `USER` (custom commands).
<li> `tag-key` - String - Required: No - (Filter condition) Filter by the tag key.</li>
<li> `tag-value` - String - Required: No - (Filter condition) Filter by the tag value.</li>
<li> `tag:tag-key` - String - Required: No - (Filter) Filter by the tag key-value pair. The tag-key should be replaced with a specified tag key. For detailed usage, see sample 4.</li>

Up to 10 `Filters` are allowed in one request. Each filter can have up to 5 `Filter.Values`. `CommandIds` and `Filters` cannot be specified at the same time.
