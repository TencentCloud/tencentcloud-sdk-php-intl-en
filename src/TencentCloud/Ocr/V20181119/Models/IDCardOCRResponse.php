`IdCard`: Base64-encoded content of the cropped ID card photo, which will be returned if `Config.CropIdCard` is set to `true`.
`Portrait`: Base64-encoded content of the ID photo on the card, which will be returned if `Config.CropPortrait` is set to `true`.

`Quality`: Image quality score, which will be returned if `Config.Quality` is set to `true`. Value range: 0–100. The lower the score, the blurrier the image. The recommended threshold is ≥ 50.
`BorderCodeValue`: Warning threshold score for incomplete ID card borders, which will be returned if `Config.BorderCheckWarn` is set to `true`. Value range: 0–100. The lower the score, the lower the probability of border occlusion. The recommended threshold value is ≤ 50.

`WarnInfos`: Warning information. Warning codes and descriptions are as follows:
-9100: The ID card validity period is invalid.
-9101: The ID card borders are incomplete.
-9102: The ID card image is photocopied.
-9103: The ID card image is spoofed. 
-9104: The ID card is a temporary one. 
-9105: The ID card frame is occluded.
-9106: The ID card image is photoshopped.
-9107: The ID card image has glares.
 * @method void setAdvancedInfo(string $AdvancedInfo) Set Extended information, which will be returned only when requested. For the input parameters, please see example 3 and example 4.
