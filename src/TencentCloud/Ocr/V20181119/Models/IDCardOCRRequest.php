/**
 * IDCardOCR request structure.
 *
 * @method string getImageBase64() Obtain The Base64-encoded value of an image. The image cannot exceed 7 MB after being Base64-encoded. A resolution above 500 x 800 is recommended. PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats are supported. It is recommended that the card part occupy more than 2/3 area of the image.
Either `ImageUrl` or `ImageBase64` of the image must be provided. If both are provided, `ImageUrl` is used.
 * @method void setImageBase64(string $ImageBase64) Set The Base64-encoded value of an image. The image cannot exceed 7 MB after being Base64-encoded. A resolution above 500 x 800 is recommended. PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats are supported. It is recommended that the card part occupy more than 2/3 area of the image.
Either `ImageUrl` or `ImageBase64` of the image must be provided. If both are provided, `ImageUrl` is used.
 * @method string getImageUrl() Obtain The URL of the image. The image cannot exceed 7 MB after being Base64-encoded. A resolution above 500 x 800 is recommended. PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats are supported. It is recommended that the card part occupy more than 2/3 area of the image.
We recommend that you store the image in Tencent Cloud for higher download speed and stability.
 * @method void setImageUrl(string $ImageUrl) Set The URL of the image. The image cannot exceed 7 MB after being Base64-encoded. A resolution above 500 x 800 is recommended. PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats are supported. It is recommended that the card part occupy more than 2/3 area of the image.
We recommend that you store the image in Tencent Cloud for higher download speed and stability.
 * @method string getCardSide() Obtain `FRONT`: The side with the profile photo.
`BACK`: The side with the national emblem.
If this parameter is not specified, the system will automatically determine the ID card side.
 * @method void setCardSide(string $CardSide) Set `FRONT`: The side with the profile photo.
`BACK`: The side with the national emblem.
If this parameter is not specified, the system will automatically determine the ID card side.
 * @method string getConfig() Obtain The following parameters are all of `bool` type and default to `false`:
`CropIdCard`: Crops the ID card photo (by removing extra edges outside the ID card and automatically correcting the shooting angle).
`CropPortrait`: Crops the profile photo (by automatically cutting out the face area in the ID card).
`CopyWarn`: Warns about photocopied images.
`BorderCheckWarn`: Warns about border and frame occlusions.
`ReshootWarn`: Warns about spoofed images.
`DetectPsWarn`: Warns about photoshopped images.
`TempIdWarn`: Warns about temporary ID cards.
`InvalidDateWarn`: Warns about invalid ID card validity periods.
`Quality`: Gets the image quality score (by evaluating the blurriness of the image).
`MultiCardDetect`: Enables multi-card detection.
`ReflectWarn`: Enables glare detection.

Parameter setting method via SDK:
Config = Json.stringify({"CropIdCard":true,"CropPortrait":true})
Parameter setting method via API 3.0 Explorer:
Config = {"CropIdCard":true,"CropPortrait":true}
 * @method void setConfig(string $Config) Set The following parameters are all of `bool` type and default to `false`:
`CropIdCard`: Crops the ID card photo (by removing extra edges outside the ID card and automatically correcting the shooting angle).
`CropPortrait`: Crops the profile photo (by automatically cutting out the face area in the ID card).
