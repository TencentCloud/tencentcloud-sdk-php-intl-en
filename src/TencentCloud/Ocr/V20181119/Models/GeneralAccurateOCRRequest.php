 * GeneralAccurateOCR request structure.
 *
 * @method string getImageBase64() Obtain Base64-encoded value of image.
The image cannot exceed 7 MB in size after being Base64-encoded. A resolution above 600x800 is recommended. PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats are supported.
Either `ImageUrl` or `ImageBase64` of the image must be provided; if both are provided, only `ImageUrl` will be used.
 * @method void setImageBase64(string $ImageBase64) Set Base64-encoded value of image.
The image cannot exceed 7 MB in size after being Base64-encoded. A resolution above 600x800 is recommended. PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats are supported.
Either `ImageUrl` or `ImageBase64` of the image must be provided; if both are provided, only `ImageUrl` will be used.
 * @method string getImageUrl() Obtain URL address of image. (This field is not supported outside Chinese mainland)
The image cannot exceed 7 MB after being Base64-encoded. A resolution above 600x800 is recommended. PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats are supported.
We recommend you store the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
 * @method void setImageUrl(string $ImageUrl) Set URL address of image. (This field is not supported outside Chinese mainland)
The image cannot exceed 7 MB after being Base64-encoded. A resolution above 600x800 is recommended. PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats are supported.
We recommend you store the image in Tencent Cloud, as a Tencent Cloud URL can guarantee higher download speed and stability. The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
 * @method boolean getIsWords() Obtain Whether to return the character information. Default value: `false`
 * @method void setIsWords(boolean $IsWords) Set Whether to return the character information. Default value: `false`
 * @method boolean getEnableDetectSplit() Obtain Whether to slice the input image to enhance the recognition effects for scenarios where the whole image is big, but the size of a single character is small (e.g., test papers). This feature is disabled by default.
 * @method void setEnableDetectSplit(boolean $EnableDetectSplit) Set Whether to slice the input image to enhance the recognition effects for scenarios where the whole image is big, but the size of a single character is small (e.g., test papers). This feature is disabled by default.
 * @method boolean getIsPdf() Obtain Whether to enable PDF recognition. Default value: `false`. If you enable this feature, both images and PDF files can be recognized.
 * @method void setIsPdf(boolean $IsPdf) Set Whether to enable PDF recognition. Default value: `false`. If you enable this feature, both images and PDF files can be recognized.
 * @method integer getPdfPageNumber() Obtain Number of a PDF page that needs to be recognized. Currently, only one single page can be recognized. This parameter takes effect only if a PDF file is uploaded and `IsPdf` is set to `true`. Default value: `1`
 * @method void setPdfPageNumber(integer $PdfPageNumber) Set Number of a PDF page that needs to be recognized. Currently, only one single page can be recognized. This parameter takes effect only if a PDF file is uploaded and `IsPdf` is set to `true`. Default value: `1`
