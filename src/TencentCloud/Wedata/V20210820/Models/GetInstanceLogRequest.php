/**
 * GetInstanceLog request structure.
 *
 * @method string getProjectId() Obtain **Project ID**.
 * @method void setProjectId(string $ProjectId) Set **Project ID**.
 * @method string getInstanceKey() Obtain Unique identifier of an instance.
 * @method void setInstanceKey(string $InstanceKey) Set Unique identifier of an instance.
 * @method integer getLifeRoundNum() Obtain Instance lifetime number, which identifies one-time execution of the instance.

For example: the number of the first run of a periodic instance is 0. when the user reruns the instance later, the number of the second execution is 1.
 * @method void setLifeRoundNum(integer $LifeRoundNum) Set Instance lifetime number, which identifies one-time execution of the instance.

For example: the number of the first run of a periodic instance is 0. when the user reruns the instance later, the number of the second execution is 1.
 * @method string getScheduleTimeZone() Obtain Time zone.
Time zone. specifies the time zone. the default value is UTC+8.
 * @method void setScheduleTimeZone(string $ScheduleTimeZone) Set Time zone.
Time zone. specifies the time zone. the default value is UTC+8.
 * @method string getBrokerIp() Obtain Indicates the Ip address of the executor where the log is located.
 * @method void setBrokerIp(string $BrokerIp) Set Indicates the Ip address of the executor where the log is located.
 * @method string getOriginFileName() Obtain Log file.
When executionJobId in instance details is empty but originFileName is not empty, originFileName and brokerIp must be included in the input parameters.
If both executionJobId and originFileName are empty, it indicates that the instance has not been dispatched for execution or has not generated logs. for example, branch node or merge node.
 * @method void setOriginFileName(string $OriginFileName) Set Log file.
When executionJobId in instance details is empty but originFileName is not empty, originFileName and brokerIp must be included in the input parameters.
If both executionJobId and originFileName are empty, it indicates that the instance has not been dispatched for execution or has not generated logs. for example, branch node or merge node.
 * @method string getExecutionJobId() Obtain **Execution ID**.

When executionJobId in instance details is not empty, executionJobId needs to be included in the input parameters. originFileName and brokerIp are not required parameters.
 * @method void setExecutionJobId(string $ExecutionJobId) Set **Execution ID**.

When executionJobId in instance details is not empty, executionJobId needs to be included in the input parameters. originFileName and brokerIp are not required parameters.
 * @method string getLogLevel() Obtain Log level.

 * @method void setStartLineNum(integer $StartLineNum) Set Start row number for obtaining logs.
The default is 1.
 * @method integer getEndLineCount() Obtain End line number for obtaining logs.
The default value is 10000.
 * @method void setEndLineCount(integer $EndLineCount) Set End line number for obtaining logs.
The default value is 10000.
 * @method string getExtInfo() Obtain Used when performing a paging query for logs. it has no specific business meaning.

Specifies that the value is null for the first query. 
Use the ExtInfo field value in the returned information from the previous query for the second and subsequent queries.
