 * CreateHourDCDBInstance response structure.
 *
 * @method array getInstanceIds() Obtain IDs of the instances you have purchased in this order. If no instance IDs are returned, you can query them with the `DescribeOrders` API. You can also use the `DescribeDBInstances` API to check whether an instance has been created successfully.
 * @method void setInstanceIds(array $InstanceIds) Set IDs of the instances you have purchased in this order. If no instance IDs are returned, you can query them with the `DescribeOrders` API. You can also use the `DescribeDBInstances` API to check whether an instance has been created successfully.
 * @method integer getFlowId() Obtain Task ID, which can be used to query the creation progress
 * @method void setFlowId(integer $FlowId) Set Task ID, which can be used to query the creation progress
 * @method string getDealName() Obtain Order ID, which is used for calling the `DescribeOrders` API.
 The parameter can be used to either query order details or call the user account APIs to make another payment when this payment fails.
 * @method void setDealName(string $DealName) Set Order ID, which is used for calling the `DescribeOrders` API.
 The parameter can be used to either query order details or call the user account APIs to make another payment when this payment fails.
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, generated by the server, will be returned for every request (if the request fails to reach the server for other reasons, the request will not obtain a RequestId). RequestId is required for locating a problem.
