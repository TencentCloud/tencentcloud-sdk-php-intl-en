/**
 * Image segment information
 *
 * @method string getOffsetTime() Obtain This field is used to return the frame capturing time of a video segment in seconds. For video on demand files, this parameter indicates the time offset of the captured image from the video, such as 0 (no offset), 5 (5 seconds after the start of the video), and 10 (10 seconds after the start of the video). For live video stream files, this parameter returns the Unix timestamp of the image, such as `1594650717`.
 * @method void setOffsetTime(string $OffsetTime) Set This field is used to return the frame capturing time of a video segment in seconds. For video on demand files, this parameter indicates the time offset of the captured image from the video, such as 0 (no offset), 5 (5 seconds after the start of the video), and 10 (10 seconds after the start of the video). For live video stream files, this parameter returns the Unix timestamp of the image, such as `1594650717`.
 * @method ImageResult getResult() Obtain This field is used to return the specific moderation result of a frame captured from a video segment. For details, see the description of the `ImageResult` data structure.
 * @method void setResult(ImageResult $Result) Set This field is used to return the specific moderation result of a frame captured from a video segment. For details, see the description of the `ImageResult` data structure.
