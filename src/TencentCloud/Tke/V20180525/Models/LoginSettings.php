 * Describes login settings of an instance.
 *
 * @method string getPassword() Obtain Login password of the instance. <br><li>For Linux instances, the password must include 8-30 characters, and contain at least two of the following character sets: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9] and [()\`~!@#$%^&*-+=|{}[]:;',.?/]. <br><li>For Windows instances, the password must include 12-30 characters, and contain at least three of the following character sets: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9] and [()\`~!@#$%^&*-+=|{}[]:;',.?/]. <br><br>If it's not specified, the user needs to set the login password using the **Reset password** option in the CVM console or calling the API `ResetInstancesPassword` to complete the creation of the CVM instance(s).
Note: This field may return `null`, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setPassword(string $Password) Set Login password of the instance. <br><li>For Linux instances, the password must include 8-30 characters, and contain at least two of the following character sets: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9] and [()\`~!@#$%^&*-+=|{}[]:;',.?/]. <br><li>For Windows instances, the password must include 12-30 characters, and contain at least three of the following character sets: [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9] and [()\`~!@#$%^&*-+=|{}[]:;',.?/]. <br><br>If it's not specified, the user needs to set the login password using the **Reset password** option in the CVM console or calling the API `ResetInstancesPassword` to complete the creation of the CVM instance(s).
Note: This field may return `null`, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method array getKeyIds() Obtain List of key IDs. After an instance is associated with a key, you can access the instance with the private key in the key pair. You can call [`DescribeKeyPairs`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15699?from_cn_redirect=1) to obtain `KeyId`. You cannot specify a key and a password at the same time. Windows instances do not support keys.
Note: This field may return `null`, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method void setKeyIds(array $KeyIds) Set List of key IDs. After an instance is associated with a key, you can access the instance with the private key in the key pair. You can call [`DescribeKeyPairs`](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15699?from_cn_redirect=1) to obtain `KeyId`. You cannot specify a key and a password at the same time. Windows instances do not support keys.
Note: This field may return `null`, indicating that no valid values can be obtained.
 * @method string getKeepImageLogin() Obtain Maintains the original settings of the image. This parameter cannot be specified simultaneously with Password or KeyIds.N. It can be set to true only when an instance is created with a custom image, shared image, or externally imported image. Valid values: <li>true: indicates that the login settings of the image are maintained</li><li>false: indicates that the login settings of the image are not maintained</li>Default value: false.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value is found.
 * @method void setKeepImageLogin(string $KeepImageLogin) Set Maintains the original settings of the image. This parameter cannot be specified simultaneously with Password or KeyIds.N. It can be set to true only when an instance is created with a custom image, shared image, or externally imported image. Valid values: <li>true: indicates that the login settings of the image are maintained</li><li>false: indicates that the login settings of the image are not maintained</li>Default value: false.
Note: This field may return null, indicating that no valid value is found.
