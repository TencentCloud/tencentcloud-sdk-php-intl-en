/**
 * CreateSnapshotTask request structure.
 *
 * @method SnapshotWhiteboard getWhiteboard() Obtain Whiteboard parameters.
 * @method void setWhiteboard(SnapshotWhiteboard $Whiteboard) Set Whiteboard parameters.
 * @method integer getSdkAppId() Obtain `SdkAppId` of the whiteboard application.
 * @method void setSdkAppId(integer $SdkAppId) Set `SdkAppId` of the whiteboard application.
 * @method integer getRoomId() Obtain Whiteboard room ID.
 * @method void setRoomId(integer $RoomId) Set Whiteboard room ID.
 * @method string getCallbackURL() Obtain Callback URL to which the whiteboard snapshot result is to be sent.
 * @method void setCallbackURL(string $CallbackURL) Set Callback URL to which the whiteboard snapshot result is to be sent.
 * @method SnapshotCOS getCOS() Obtain `COS` bucket in which the generated whiteboard snapshot file is to be stored. If you leave this parameter empty, the generated file will be stored in the public bucket and retained for only three days.
 * @method void setCOS(SnapshotCOS $COS) Set `COS` bucket in which the generated whiteboard snapshot file is to be stored. If you leave this parameter empty, the generated file will be stored in the public bucket and retained for only three days.
 * @method string getSnapshotMode() Obtain Whiteboard snapshot mode. Default value: `AllMarks`. Valid values:

`AllMarks`: Full mode. In this mode, a snapshot image is generated based on each whiteboard snapshot mark that is added by calling the `addSnapshotMark` API on the client.

`LatestMarksOnly`: Single-page deduplication mode. In this mode, a snapshot image is generated based only on the latest whiteboard snapshot mark that is added by calling the `addSnapshotMark` API on the client if the API is called multiple times for the same whiteboard snapshot.

**Note: The `LatestMarksOnly` mode takes effect only when the `addSnapshotMark` API is called by using Tencent Interactive Whiteboard SDK v2.6.8 or later. Otherwise, even if this parameter is set to `LatestMarksOnly`, the default `AllMarks` mode is used.**
 * @method void setSnapshotMode(string $SnapshotMode) Set Whiteboard snapshot mode. Default value: `AllMarks`. Valid values:

`AllMarks`: Full mode. In this mode, a snapshot image is generated based on each whiteboard snapshot mark that is added by calling the `addSnapshotMark` API on the client.
